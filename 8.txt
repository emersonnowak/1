carried on pastoral work. According to some accounts, married
priests were more dedicated to working with their parishioners than
celibates, who tended instead to continue their education.452
However, Bishop Khomyshyn argued that a celibate priest was more
inclined to make sacrifices, even of his life, than one with family
responsibilities. He was also readier to engage in social work: it was
celibate priests, and not married priests or laymen, who worked in
Catholic orphanages.453
Married as opposed to celibate priests seem to have enjoyed the
approval of a good part of the laity. In the anonymous brochure of
1929 directed against Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi's imposition of celibacy
and other alleged abuses, the theory was put forth that compulsory
priestly celibacy was a Polish plan to undermine the Greek-Catholic
clergy, who "through family ties have become fused with the people
and have become its strength." 454 This in turn was part of a broader
plan of social and political domination:
For while in earlier times, celibacy might have
been only one of the auxiliary methods by which
to destroy the enemy, today its has become

foremost and urgent. In Soviet Ukraine, the
social structure of the village has already
changed, while here change is coming too,
though by other ways. And some day the priest's
household will share the fate of today's estate: it
will be called upon to become a center of culture,
an aid to social order, not only a religious-moral
bastion but a patrician of national life. For
without patricians no people can exist. If it lacks
its own, it must have others'. But in doing this it
will give those others dominance over itself.
Our neighbours understand this well and, as
a counterweight, they hurriedly build koci64ki
and, per fas et nefas, they obtain land for the
maintenance of pastors. They also understand
that the home of our married clergy must be a
powerful factor, and that it must be neutralised.
And the surest way to convert the clergy to a
plebeian psychology, to athmise it, to tear it away
from its broad native horizons, to draw it away
from the peasant or else to drown it in the
peasants' mire, to ingratiate oneself "with cap
and pap" and to make it the handle of the axe
that is to undercut the very trunk of the people,
the peasant mass, is -- aside from material
subversion -- celibacy. Only boundless
naivete fails to see this, while boundless
venality fails to admit it.
The "unseen hand" whispers to us that
celibacy, as a high virtue, is an end in itself,
which shall become an abundant source of
grace. But in fact celibacy is not an end, but a
means by which they can achieve their end.
And the end? To deprive the Ukrainian peasant
people of its spiritual and material basis, to bring
about its total impoverishment and to conquer it
once and for all.455
The author of the brochure also claimed that, contrary to the
assertions of the Polish publication Czas ("an organ of the Cracow
Jesuits and Staiiczyks"), the Ukrainian peasantry was not
indifferent to the issue of priestly celibacy. Rather, it was "extremely
hostile to priestly celibacy," since it desired to see its pastors as
examples of family morality. The author, presumably a member of
the Ukrainian intelligentsia, associated celibacy with the stereotype
of Polish corruption and hypocrisy, by contrast with the equally
stereotypical morality of the Ukrainian peasant:
455   V oboroni pray 61.
139
[Our people] is scandalised and looks with
contempt on the "housekeepers" and "cousins"
of Polish priests. Our people does not understand
"two sets of books" in morality: one from the
pulpit, another in practice, to which the Poles
have become accustomed with regard to their
priests. And it is precisely for this reason that
our peasantry will most decisively oppose
celibacy, as a blow against village morality and
as a bridge to Latinism and to Poland.456
3. Solidarity
Socio-economic changes in Galician society as well as the
imposition of compulsory celibacy undermined the priestly caste and
paved the way for the creation of a new type of clergy. In the
meantime, there was a danger that the priests' esprit de corps, their
sense of professional solidarity, might suffer. Andrei Sheptyts'kyi
recognised this danger even before he had assumed the Metropolitan
seat. In his first pastoral letter as Bishop of Stanyslaviv in 1899,
addressed to the clergy of the eparchy, he lamented the fact that the
clergy had lost its sense of solidarity along with its leadership of
society. The clergy was often divided among itself, due to the
development of political, scholarly and literary life. Sheptyts'kyi
ended his letter with a call for "MORE MUTUAL SOLIDARITY!"
and an appeal to his priests to be "of one spirit." 457 In his 1902
pastoral letter to the clergy on canonical visitations, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi again emphasised the importance of priestly solidarity,
and decried the party strife and other political and national conflicts
that divided the clergy.458
On 13 February 1905 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, Bishop
Konstantyn Chekhovych of Peremyshl' and Bishop Hryhorii
Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv issued their first joint pastoral letter to

their clergy, "On Solidarity." They flatly stated that in their province
"a clergy, as a solid body" did not exist. "Clergy" was but a concept: it
existed only in theory. Among the reasons for this were the lack of a
priestly spirit, as well as political party strife and language
differences which reflected the divisions among the laity. In
particular they criticised priests who published articles in the press
attacking Church authorities and institutions as well as one
another. Aside from matters of material or practical interest, the
Greek-Catholic priests could only form a majority in support of an
enterprise if it was wrapped in "patriotic clothing." The bishops
advised their clergy to concentrate more on spiritual matters such
as reading the Bible, praying, making confession and conducting
spiritual exercises. This would lead to greater solidarity.459
One cause of friction among priests was their interference in
each other's parishes. Populist priests would sometimes found
reading rooms propagating their ideology in the parishes of the
conservative Russophiles, much to the latter's annoyance. This
caused so much conflict that on 27 July 1908, the L'viv Metropolitan
Ordinariat issued a regulation prohibiting parish priests from
interfering in the affairs of each other's parishes.46Â°
"The Problem of the Unification of Forces of the Ruthenian
Clergy" was the theme of an address presented at the general
meeting of the Society of St. Paul the Apostle on 8 December 1910 in
L'viv by Fr. IosyfBotsian. Fr. Botsian stressed that unity amongst the
Ruthenian clergy was necessary in the face of multiple threats from
a hostile press, a religiously indifferent intelligentsia, schismatic
propaganda, and a "soul- snatching polonising attack on our rite and
our clergy." If the course of the past twenty years were to continue,
he declared, then in another twenty years there would be no more
need for the Greek-Catholic clergy. Idle, they would be entirely
discredited, as among the Czechs and the French. But it was not a
matter of defending the clergy's position, influence or interests as a
professional class, but of defending the faith of the people from the

twin threats of atheism and Orthodoxy. It was this that required
unity, that demanded "closed ranks facing two fronts."461
Evidently, the Greek-Catholic parish clergy's engagement in
civic and economic work in the nineteenth century had led to a
certain secularisation of their outlook, to the detriment of spirituality
and priestly solidarity. 462 An anonymous priest looking back in 1937
to the early years of the century wrote that some priests preferred to
associate with atheists, Radicals and schismatics of their own
political party while regarding priests of another party as enemies.
Priests filled the periodicals of the time with "lampoons, calumny,
malicious gossip, baseless attacks against priests and even Bishops."
The priests' overzealous involvement in the reading-room movement
divided them further. It would even happen that while one priest was
celebrating Mass, his neighbour would come to the village and,
without his knowledge or approval, hold a meeting at the reading-
room.463
Priestly solidarity was one of the topics to be discussed at the
extraordinary deanery meetings ordered by the Peremyshi' episcopal
ordinariat in early 1912. Dean Teodor Merena stated at the Korosno
deanery meeting on 3 February 1912 that despite the bishops' appeal
of 1905, not all the priests of his deanery communicated with each
other, and hatred remained. They were undermining each other's
authority in the eyes of the faithful.464
In the period before World War One, much of the divisiveness
among the Greek-Catholic clergy stemmed from conflicts between
Old Ruthenians and Russophiles on the one hand, and populists on
the other. These movements will be discussed in Chapter Six. In the
1920s and 1930s, they were supplanted by other cultural and political
trends. However, the problem of clerical solidarity had not been
eliminated. In 1927 Fr. Ivan Shpytal' addressed a meeting of the
clergy of the Staryi Sambir deanery, saying that solidarity was

needed in the face of anti-Christian threats and of the declining
significance of the clerical state in society.465
The lack of solidarity appears to have been one aspect of a
general problem of priestly morale. Various observers diagnosed this
condition differently and attributed it to different causes. In August
1905 Bishop Khomyshyn blamed poor seminary education for the
"mechanical and cold" character of pastoral work and the clergy's
lack of initiative. Lacking a strong apostolic spirit, the clergy could
not struggle against destructive currents and instead sought strange
harmonies between Christian principles and trends hostile to the
faith. Priests' families followed secular fashions, and "rarely can you
find a priestly family that would say their morning and evening
prayers together."466
At Lent in the following year, an anonymous author (probably
a priest) blamed the centralism of earlier church administrations for
the passive character of the priesthood. The consistory at L'viv had
ceased to be a representative organ of the clergy, and was reduced to
a humble bureaucratic office. Accustomed to taking orders, the
priests were incapable of taking any initiative. The hierarchy, for
their part, were "crushed by our difficult times;" they did not even
dare to think about raising the prestige and authority of their
Church from second-rate status. Pastoral letters about solidarity had
been to no avail; what was needed was a spirit of independent action
which, arising from an awareness of the threat to the Greek-Catholic
Church and of that Church's lofty mission, would "electrify the
entire collective organism of our clergy." The clergy bore all the signs
of death, like Lazarus -- but like Lazarus, it would awaken to its
historic mission.467
The laymen of the Peremyshi' eparchy who complained in
1926 to the Pope about their bishop blamed him for the
demoralisation of their clergy through discriminatory distribution of
beneflces, honours, offices and favours. 468 The anonymous, probably
lay author of the 1929 brochure cited above painted a strange and
melancholy picture of clerical life in the Stanyslaviv eparchy:

In Stanyslaviv the clergy today is already
divided, weakened, humiliated, totally converted
into a "Church obedient." Only two priests, if
they are friends, can converse sincerely, when
they have the good fortune to meet. If a third is
present it is already dangerous, for one cannot
know whether he might not make a
denunciation. More numerous meetings are
permitted only in the presence of a "man of
confidence." And as for these "men of
confidence" -- who can enumerate them and
who can grasp their task? The eparchial funds
serve different persons and different aims. One
can only read what the authorities permit.
Participation in civic organisations is possible
only secretly, or with a planned anti-civic goal.
A1l of life is confined to the sacristy....469
Writing in the January 1935 issue of Nyva, Fr. Vasyl'
Pryshliak observed that poverty aggravated the problem of morale:
"We see that together with economic decline comes moral
depression." He described the threats and pressures that
demoralised and sometimes divided the priests of the L'viv
archeparchy:
Finally the morally negative factors, which
are visibly growing stronger, strike us from all
sides -- from our flock, from leftist elements,
from sectarian religious subversion, and in
addition from external factors.
we regret to state that the present moment is
the least propitious for our efforts. For not only
has it nurtured material need, but it
methodically strives to break the spirit of our
clergy. Here and there it makes breakthroughs,
destroying personalities, and we look in helpless
dismay at the lack of discipline of certain
individuals who compromise both the clerical
state and their sacred mission.
Contrary to the canons and professional
discipline, our prestige is infringed, for
aspirations and ambitions thrive. Not
infrequently, the contacts of some of us go so far
that they draw outside factors, hostile to us, into
the whirlpool of their professional affairs -- and
there rises to the surface an unpleasant
embarrassment and the humiliation not only of
an individual, but of the entire clerical state, in

which they somehow found themselves by
chance.47Â°
In Nyva's April-May issue of that year, Fr. Pryshliak wrote
that his fellow priests were for the most part scattered and passive.
Even those who contributed to Nyva confined themselves to academic
questions instead of tackling live, contemporary issues.471
In the Stanyslaviv eparchy, the jailing of priests for
"falsification" of parish records contributed to low morale. "The very
great and almost universal material poverty and moral depression
creates in some priests a kind of indifference to general church
matters, so that almost nothing interests them," reported Dobryi
Pastyr in its chronicle for the year 1939.472
Efforts were made to remedy the problems of divisiveness and
demoralisation. There were priestly societies, charitable funds, and
publications. In their 1905 joint pastoral letter on priestly solidarity,
the Greek-Catholic bishops of Galicia complained that general
meetings of the Society of St. Peter or St. Paul drew only ten to twenty
priests, and rarely took any positive action. The widows' and
orphans' funds depended on the work of a few, and it took all the
pressure that could be exerted by the deaneries, consistories and
ordinariat to compel priests to make donations. When a clerical
newspaper appeared, they noted, out of nearly 3,000 priests one or two
hundred at most would subscribe, and hardly any would send
contributions. 473 In 1906 the pseudonymous author of the pamphlet
De ie ruskyi klyr? ("Where is the Ruthenian clergy?") reported that
the Society of St. Paul the Apostle, which ought to crystallise the
clergy's thinking about its ideal and its mission, had many members
but so few active ones that only 24 had attended the annual general
meeting that year.474
Priestly apathy was not the only problem. The Society of St.
Paul the Apostle, which published the journal Nyva from 1904, was
dissolved by the government in 1925, evidently because it protested
government action to the League of Nations. In its place was founded
the Society of St. Andrew the Apostle. The Theological Scholarly

Society, founded in 1923, published the journal Bohosloviia and also
took over Nyva. In the Peremyshi' eparchy, a priests' mutual aid
society known as Peremys'ka Eparkhiial'na Pomich, founded in
1918, included nearly the entire clergy. There were accusations,
however, that Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi had founded this Society to
counter-act the Fund for Priests' Widows and Orphans. In
Stanyslaviv, the Society of Celibate Priests of St. Josaphat, which
published "Dobryi Pastyr" and initiated "Nova Zoria," comprised the
entire eparchial clergy. There was also a mutual aid society which
provided funds for funerals and aided widows of priests.475
Nevertheless, in 1935 Fr. Lev Hlynka expressed the opinion that
eparchial priestly societies were not enough; what was needed was a
single priests' organisation for the entire Galician province to defend
the material and moral interests of the clergy.476
Among the editors of Nyva after World War One were Fr.
Iaroslav Levyts'kyi (see Chapter 2), Fr. Havryil Kostel'nyk (1920 to
October 1929), Fr. Petro Khomyn (November 1929 to January 1938),
and Fr. P. Kozits'kyi (February 1938 to the last issue in 1939). In the
1930s the journal was frequently censored, and the entire issue for
May, 1934 was confiscated, though some copies were distributed.477
As had been frankly stated in that year's January issue, every editor
of a Ukrainian publication was surrounded by prohibitions,
censorship and the danger of fines. Both ecclesiastical and
governmental pressures forced the editor of a religious journal in
particular to keep to the narrow limits of permissible content. 478 By
the late 1930s the journal had taken on a rather sedate character,
avoiding polemics and dedicating more attention to historical
subjects.
In December 1937, Nyva criticised Bishop Khomyshyn's
instructions to his clergy not to participate in secular organisations.
One year later Bishop Khomyshyn announced in his official bulletin
that his clergy were henceforth forbidden to subscribe to Nyva

"directly or indirectly," or to read it. The resulting debate continued
into 1939.
Bishop Khomyshyn did have his own publication for the clergy,
the weekly newspaper "Nova Zoria," published from 1926. For two
years it was edited by the seminary rector Fr. Tyt Halushchyns'kyi, a
Basilian. Then the well-known journalist Osyp Nazaruk, a former
free-thinker and anti-clericalist, took over and continued a spirited
attack on the Bishop's opponents, especially Nyva. "Nova Zoria" soon
had a print run of 5,000. Later it began to appear twice a week, and
claimed 10,000 subscribers. 480 Unlike Nyva, "Nova Zoria" was
directed at a broader audience, including the secular intelligentsia.
4. Priests and Bishops
It was not only in the Greek-Catholic Church that conflicts
occasionally arose between the lower clergy and their bishops. In
societies where the episcopate was drawn from the aristocracy,
differences were inevitable. The fact that bishops were drawn from
the monastic clergy added a further dimension to these differences,
in both the Eastern and the Western Church. 481 In the Greek-
Catholic Church, the Basilian monastic order had become the sole
source of bishops, though after the L'viv provincial synod of 1891 non-
monastic priests (such as Bishop Khomyshyn) could be consecrated
as well.
One way in which bishops differed from parish priests
was education (see Chapter One). Generally, future bishops were
sent abroad to study. Those who went to Innsbruck or Rome to be
educated by the Jesuits naturally came under western and
specifically Latin influences sometimes resented by the rank and file
clergy. When the students of the Ruthenian seminary in Rome were

Church, Pospielovsky attributes this conflict to the "learned" or "academic"
monasticism required of those aspiring to episcopal careers, a worldly
phenomenon borrowed in the seventeenth century from the Roman Catholic
Church by the Kiev Academy and having nothing to do with genuine
monasticism. Andrei Sheptyts'kyi referred to the hostility of priests towards
monks, who were accused of ambition, in his first pastoral letter as Bishop of
Stanyslaviv, on 2 August 1899. "Nasha prohrama," in Tvorv Sluh y Bozhoho

transferred in 1904 from the tutelage of the Jesuits to that of the
Basilians, the objection remained, for the Basilians (particularly
after their reform by the Jesuits in 1882) were known for their
latinising tendencies.482
The political role of the episcopate was another potential
source of friction with the lower clergy. The attempts of Metropolitan
Syl'vester Sembratovych (1885-1898) to find a political accommodation
with the Poles, which failed along with Barvins'kyi's "New Era,"
were opposed by the lower clergy, and created a gulf between priests
and bishop.483
In the joint pastoral letter of 1905 to the clergy, the three
eparchial bishops criticised the improper understanding of priestly
solidarity which pitted the clergy against their bishop. Too often
priests would fail to inform their bishop of their fellows' errors (after
reproaches in private and at a deanery meeting had failed). Yet they
accused the bishops of failing to solidarise with them. "You wish us
bishops to be in solidarity with you, but you do not consider yourselves
obligated to help us in that which is the most difficult part of our
duties in correcting those who are falling or who have fallen," they
wrote. Furthermore, there were priests who criticised "every step of
the bishop" in the press. "When enemies publicly attack us, there are
those among you who are glad of this!" 484 A Polish observer wrote in
1912 that the Greek-Catholic clergy were divided from, and hostile to,
their bishops.485 In his 1910 address before the Society of St. Paul the
Apostle in L'viv, Fr. losyf Botsian (who less than four years later
would be consecrated Bishop of Lutsk in a Kiev hotel room by his
fellow prisoner Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi) denounced the habit of
criticising the civic and even the church activity of one's bishop,
which on the part of intemperate priests would sometimes culminate
in a declaration of no confidence in him. Confidence in the bishop
and unity with him, said Fr. Botsian, was "the first and necessary
condition" for the unification of the clergy.486
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi sought to bring the eparchial clergy
closer to the episcopate, visiting the priests of the L'viv archeparchy

every summer beginning in 1902 and continuing, with interruptions,
until his illness prevented further travel in 1932. In this time,
according to Korolevskij, he managed to visit each deanery.487
Episcopal visitations were not always appreciated by the parish
priests. It did occur that during a visitation the priest would prevent
persons with a grievance against him from seeing the bishop. In
their 1905 pastoral letter the bishops pointed out that the parish
clergy should regard them as friends, not enemies. "Truly, the
behaviour of many towards us is at times so insincere that it would
appear that distrust of authority has become a general rule."488
The clergy had their own complaints against their bishops. As
suggested by the remarks of the pseudonymous pamphleteer of 1906
cited above, there was a feeling that the hierarchy was not doing
enough to protect the Church. Nor, in his opinion, did the bishops
protect their clergy from attacks by the laity and by the Polish
clergy.489
Writing in 1934, Henryk Ignacy Lubieiski attributed the
conflict between the Greek-Catholic bishops and clergy to the
persistent influence of Byzantine Orthodox tradition. In discipline,
he stated, Greek-rite priests differed greatly from Latin-rite clerics.
Historically, Greek-Catholic priests had often demonstrated hostility
to their bishops, such as to Metropolitan Sembratovych; now Bishop
Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv was the victim. Most of the Greek-Catholic
clergy, even in his own eparchy, opposed his pronouncements. They
concurred, or at any rate silently acquiesced, in the campaign to
overturn his authority and to discredit him publicly. They brought
secular Ukrainian society into the fray, inspiring press campaigns
against their bishops. But the bishops themselves were not without
fault, noted Lubiettski; when the clergy of two eparchies signed a
petition protesting against a decision of the bishop of the third, their
bishops did not object.49Â°
The clergy, as represented by the editors of Nyva, defended
their right to dissent publicly from their bishops' orders. Surely, they
wrote in 1939, they were not obligated to agree to everything "like a

dumb herd." After all, the bishop's ideas were not infallible. In
matters that did not directly concern dogma or the bishop's
authority, it was permissible to express a different opinion in the
press. As long as they did not violate the general discipline of the
Church, the priests could advocate an ideology different from that of
their bishop. As for Bishop Khomyshyn's order forbidding his clergy
to read Nyva -- the point of departure of this editorial -- it was
unheard of that one bishop should forbid his clergy to read a
publication that was published by permission of another.49'
Despite the controversies over celibacy, participation in secular
organisations and Nyva, Bishop Khomyshyn appears to have had
close and cordial relations with his clergy. Fr. Roman Lobodych
(ordained in 1917), rector of the Stanyslaviv cathedral from 1930 to
1935, recalls that the bishop frequently visited his priests,
particularly those who were ill or in prison, and helped them
financially. Although he opposed a married clergy, he placed
married priests from the other two eparchies in wealthier parishes
near towns, so that they could support their families and send their
children to school. He also cared for deceased priests' widows and
orphans. As a result, writes Fr. Lobodych, the Stanyslaviv eparchial
clergy were especially respectftil and obedient.492
While the attacks against Bishop Khomyshyn may indeed have
come primarily from the other eparchies, in the 1920s Bishop
Kotsylovs'kyi faced a virtual rebellion by his own eparchial clergy. He
was attacked by both priests and laymen for alleged misconduct in a
variety of matters: the introduction of compulsory celibacy,
administrative abuses (particularly his conflicts with the cathedral
chapter), eparchial finances, the events leading to his removal from
the patronage of the Institute for Girls in Peremyshi', and abuses
regarding an orphanage in that town. 493 The bishop was also
accused of tactless conduct towards the clergy, notably when at the
ceremony of the coronation of an icon of the Mother of God in Sambir
on 27 August 1928, he reportedly interrupted a sermon of Fr. Symeon
Kul'chyts'kyi, loudly commanding him to "climb down" from the
pulpit.494

Clerical collusion in the lay attacks on Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi is
alleged in the 1927 reply to the bill of complaints of the Peremyshi'
secular intelligentsia (actually addressed to the Pro-Nuncio in
Warsaw) by Luigi Cardinal Sincero, Secretary of the Sacred
Congregation for the Eastern Church. In this reply, Cardinal
Sincero spoke of "some sort of ill-concealed understanding or
conspiracy between some priests and laymen, aimed at causing the
removal of their own Bishop-Ordinary from his see -- which is
clearly apparent from the complaint itself."495
However, not the entire clergy of the Peremyshi' eparchy was
ranged against their bishop. At a secret meeting held in Peremyshi'
on 24 November 1926, 46 priests signed six resolutions in defence of
Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi. Among them were resolutions censuring the
"systemetic press attacks against bishops," and calling on the clergy
to defend them. They also decided to send a telegram of support to
Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi, and to support church publications such as
Bishop Khomyshyn's "Nova Zoria." It may be significant that the
apparent initiators of the meeting, and many if not most of the
signatories to the resolutions, were deans or other higher clergy.496

CHAPTER FIVE: CLERGY AND LAITY
It seems that there is no other state in human
society that would have such a varied fate as the
clerical state. On the one hand, high honour
amongst the people, esteem even from strangers
because of our clerical garb alone, but on the
other hand disdain and hatred from elements
hostile to the Church, and vexation from the
Radical and socialist press. Just as honour for
the priest for the lofty mission which he is
fulfilling amongst the people, and for his high
office, is completely natural, so hostility and
hatred towards the clergy cannot at all be
justified.497
Thus wrote Fr. Iuliian Dzerovych in the clerical journal Nyva
in 1912. His words may recall the complaint of Iaroslav Levyts'kyi
about public perceptions of L'viv seminarians made in 1901, and
quoted in the first chapter. Unlike seminarians, however, ordained
parish priests lived their entire lives in the midst of civil society. They
encountered the laity on a daily basis and to an extent were
dependent on them for support. The Greek-Catholic parish clergy's
relations with their parishioners in town and country, both in the
pastoral setting and beyond it, are the subject of this chapter.
1. Pastoral Work
In a province with as high a birth-rate as Galicia, one would
expect that adequate pastoral care would have required a growth in
the number of priests. The over-all number of Greek-Catholic priests
did in fact grow during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
century. 498 In inter-war Poland, the ratio of priests of all rites to
faithful improved, and between 1934 and 1937, the number of Catholic
diocesan priests of all rites grew by However, it appears that
the number of Greek-Catholic parish priests remained fairly
constant between 1900 and 1939. According to one source, there were
2,483 Greek-Catholic priests distributed over 1,875 parishes in "Little

Poland" in 1914.500 Fr. Tadeusz 1iwa states, however, that
"immediately before World War I" there were 2,478 Greek-Catholic
priests in the province, of whom 2,235 were parish priests. 50 ' A
government source indicated in 1935 that there were 2,198 Greek-
Catholic secular priests in Poland, with 1,854 parishes. 502 In 1938-
1939 there were 2,284 Greek-Catholic priests in Poland, with 2,491
parishes.503 liwa counts 2,232 Greek-Catholic parish priests in 1937-
1938.Â° Accepting his figures as true, it would appear that the
number of Greek-Catholic parish priests was remarkably static
throughout most of the period under study. 1iwa remarks, however,
that after the first world war the number of priests diminished, to be
replaced subsequently by younger priests of a different ideological
persuasion. 505 Thus, quantitative stability may disguise qualitative
change.
Yet as mentioned in the previous chapter, the density of the
network of Greek-Catholic parishes and churches in relation to the
population was considered to be greater than that of the Latin rite,
giving the former an advantage in pastoral competition. According to
a 1929 report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in L'viv county the
Latin-rite population was somewhat larger than the Greek-rite
population (1,284,000 as against 1,141,000), but the number of Latin-
rite parishes was much smaller than that of Greek-rite parishes: 386
as compared with 697. Also, there were 39 Latin-rite churches and
chapels in the county as against 113 Greek-rite churches and
chapels.506 (It must be remembered, however, that the large Polish
population was heavily concentrated in the city of L'viv, where the
Latin-rite churches could be visited by Roman Catholics more easily

than if they had been in the less densely populated countryside.) In
1914 there were 1,854 Greek-Catholic parishes in Poland; in 1938,
1,970.Â°
It would follow that in Galicia, Greek-Catholic parishes had
smaller populations than Latin-rite parishes, resulting in greater
availability of pastoral care. This is confirmed by comparing the
figures cited further in this paragraph with the average number of
faithful per Latin-rite parish in Galicia around 1910, which was
4,362. 508 However, the average Greek-Catholic parish population
grew in two of the three Galician eparchies. Before World War I, the
average number of faithful per Greek-Catholic parish was 1,773 in
the L'viv archeparchy, 1,749 in the Peremyshl' eparchy, and 2,343 in
the Stanyslaviv eparchy. Before World War II the corresponding
numbers were 1,067.62, 1,982.17, and 2,484.54. Yet Fr. liwa's
figures would yield an over-all average of about 1,983 Greek-Catholic
faithful per parish in 1914, and only about 1,927 in 1938. While these
figures indicate greater availability of pastoral care for the Greek-
Catholics, the concentration of the Polish population and of Latin-rite
churches in the towns and cities would have enhanced the apparent
availability of pastoral care for the Latin rite somewhat.
More relevant to the question of pastoral care, however, is the
number of faithful per parish priest. On the basis of Fr. liwa's
figures, 51 Â° in 1914 there were on the average about 1,645 Greek-
Catholic faithful per parish priest, rising to about 1,700 in the late
1930s (though an alternative figure cited by liwa would yield 1,495).
This would confirm the expectation that given a fairly constant
number of parish priests and a rising population, the ratio of priests
to faithful would have deteriorated somewhat.
Some notion of parishioners' access to their priest is given by
figures on the number of parishes consisting of more than one
village. In the Peremyshl' Greek-Catholic eparchy in 1928, for
example, out of 688 parishes only 189 consisted of one village, while
499 included more than one village. In the Stanyslaviv eparchy in
1925, out of 417 parishes only 196 were limited to a single village,

while 221 comprised more than one village. 51 ' The distances that a
priest had to travel to reach his faithful were aggravated by the
mountainous terrain in parts of the Stanyslaviv and Peremyshi'
eparchies. The unavailability of a Greek-Catholic priest was an
invitation for transfers to the Latin rite or even conversions to
Orthodoxy.512
At least as important as the availability of pastoral care was its
quality. In 1901, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi called on the clergy of the
metropolitan province to cultivate a spirit of sacrifice, going beyond
their obligations to engage in social and cultural work, so as to bridge
the social gap that separated the clergy from the people. Priests must
help the people educate themselves and improve their material life.
At the same time, they must double their efforts to teach the Gospel;
otherwise, he warned, the economic and educational movement
would turn against them and the Church. 513
The Greek-Catholic bishops were evidently not satisfied with
the general level of pastoral care. In their joint pastoral letter of 1905
on priestly solidarity, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and his fellow
bishops indicated some of the typical failings of the parish clergy:
neglect of preaching and catechesis, malicious gossip, failure to see
to it that their families and servants attended liturgy on Sundays and
holidays, a lack of reverence at the altar, incomplete or careless
recitation of sacramental formulae, hasty confessions, hurried
celebration of the liturgy.514
About six months later, Bishop Khomyshyn bluntly told his
clergy that they had been taken unawares by the various anti-
Christian currents of the day, mostly because of deficient preparation
in the seminary. Their pastoral work was inadequate: "In sermons --
banality and longwindedness, in confession of the faithful a
deficiency of spiritual guidance, in church singing a noisy
barbarism, in ritual a lack of taste and a chaotic disunity, and in
many churches a lack of aesthetics, dirt and neglect, which all
combine to repel the faithful rather than to attract them." He

reminded his priests that in order to be able to influence their flocks,
they must first educate themselves. They must learn to preach
plainly and effectively, stressing Catholic and not simply "Christian"
teaching. In particular, Bishop Khomyshyn prescribed steps for
sounder catechesis. 515 In a pastoral letter addressed to his eparchial
clergy six years later, in 1911, Bishop Khomyshyn mentioned their
pastoral work among the positive recent developments in what were
generally evil times for the Church.516
A major problem in pastoral activity before World War One
was the threat of Orthodox conversions. Russophiles and proponents
of Orthodoxy had found compelling arguments for their cause in the
frequent conversions of Greek-Catholics to the Latin rite, mentioned
above. In 1912 Fr. E. Krynyts'kyi, parish priest at Bobiatyn, wrote to
the Peremyshi' episcopal ordinariat that priests should sign public
protests against the schism, and appeal to the public authorities to
defend the Greek-Catholic Church by banning "Russian spies and
agitators" and their periodicals and organisations. He also called for
priestly solidarity, and the splitting of some of the overly extensive
deaneries to ensure better control.517
In addition to the effects of general devastation, pastoral work
was impeded in the wake of the world war because of the arrest and
deportation of a large number of Greek-Catholic priests, and the
flight of others (see Chapter Six). Some also died of typhus. This left
many of the remaining priests in charge of several parishes.518
In the inter-war period, Catholic pastoral work throughout
Poland aimed at (1) deepening religious life, (2) forming a defensive
and an offensive attitude towards groups advocating a world view
hostile to Catholicism, (3) solving the social question, (4) raising the
level of culture and education, and (5) providing a civic-patriotic
education. A prime means of defending the Church's positions and
increasing its social influence was the "apostolate of the laity."
