seminarian was under the supervision of his parish priest -- a less
liberal treatment than that accorded French or Belgian
seminarians, 202 though perhaps more so than that imposed on
Polish seminarians. 203
In the first years of the enlarged seminary of the 1920s, both
academic and spiritual life was in the hands of the Basilian monks
who, according to alumnus Nykolai Voiakovs'kyi, inculcated in the
students a love of the spiritual life and a spirit of self-sacrifice.
Indeed, he recalls that the material conditions at the L'viv seminary
provided an excellent opportunity to practise self-denial, for there
were food shortages and rationing. The constant lack of funds
prevented the administration from repairing broken windows, so
that one night, when the wind blew out the newspaper covering
Voiakovs'kyi's window, the snow fell in and his hair froze to the
pillow. In 1920-192 1 there was a shortage of fuel. For three months,
supper consisted of potatoes, bread, and tea with saccharine. When
conditions improved, luxuries like sugar and salt occasionally

became available. 204 Voiakovs'kyi also recalls the spiritual
"metamorphosis" effected by the Rev. Halushchyns'kyi's first
sermon during the yearly eight-day retreat, persuading the
seminarians that fulfilling the rule of absolute silence during the
entire eight days was not beyond their powers. 205 Indeed, physical
hardship may have promoted spiritual growth. In the 1930s, once or
twice a month between ten and fifteen students at a time would eat
only the soup course at meals, offering their second course to poor
students who could not afford to pay for meals in the refectory. 206
Both Voiakovs'kyi and Volodymyr Pelekh, who attended the
L'viv seminary about ten years after him (in 1931-1936), speak
warmly of student-faculty relations, noting that the seminarians
referred to their rector as "daddy." 207 In fact, such a filial
relationship was mandated by the rules. 208
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's reform and subsequent expansion
of the L'viv seminary affected academic life no less than spiritual life.
Yet change was slow in coming. In 1916, a priest had complained in
Nyva that the seminarians were being taught almost nothing of the
history of the Greek-Catholic church and rite, and did not even have
the chance to learn the Bible in the church language in which they
would celebrate mass as priests. Seminary graduates, having been
taught in Latin, did not know Ukrainian theological terminology,
while the only available book on the history of their church was in
German. 209 As long as the L'viv seminarians had to take their
courses at the University, this was likely to remain the case. In 1919,
however, courses were instituted at the seminary. By 1922 or 1923, the
students could study Church Slavonic, the history of the Greek-
Catholic Church, and Eastern dogmatics, and art history, as well as
novel subjects like "Causes of Atheism" and "The Social Question,"
both taught by the Rev. Havryil Kostel'nyk. The noted philologist and
Orthodox theologian Ivan Ohienko taught Ukrainian orthography,
and the well-known Eastern Ukrainian poet Mykola Voronyi, now in

exile from Soviet Ukraine, was brought in for a while to teach diction
and the art of lecturing; his declamations reportedly made a lasting
impression on the students. 210 When in 1928 the seminary became a
full-fledged five-year academy, obviating altogether the need for
students to attend lectures at the University, this programme was
expanded.
The founding of the Academy was not, however, an easy
matter. The government, suspecting nationalist aims, sought to block
the project. 211 In the meantime, the Rev. Tosyf Slipyi travelled to
western Europe to study theological education and examine the
statutes of higher theological institutions. He prepared a statute for
the L'viv academy, which was discussed by a three-man commission
and approved by the metropolitan on 22 February 1928. The Academy
was not officially opened until 6 October 1929, with Rev. losyf Slipyi as
rector. In his speech on that occasion, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi
outlined the new institution's aims, pointing out that they were
conditioned by his Church's special position as a mediator between
the Byzantine East and the Latin West. 212 He also observed that
whereas at the turn of the century, when materialism still prevailed,
theology was not considered a science, over the past thirty years this
attitude had changed. 213
The contemporary press generally saw the Academy as the
germ of either a Ukrainian university or a Catholic Oriental
university intended to educate priests who in turn could teach the
faith in a manner comprehensible to the peoples of the East. 214 In its
first three years (1928-1931), the Academy had around 150 to 190
students from the L'viv archeparchy and several from the
Peremyshi' eparchy; 116 completed their studies during this time. 215
These students followed a five-year course the that reflected the
metropolitan's concern with teaching both the Western and Eastern

response to the challenge presented by the Orthodox theological faculties in
Warsaw and Cernauti (Romania). Such a response was impossible at the
latinised and polonised theological faculty at the University of Lviv.

church tradition. The desiderata set forth in the pseudonymous
article of 1916 in Nyva cited above, 216 already embodied in the
seminary's programme of courses in the early 1920s, were expanded
upon. A lay church historian, Mykola Chubatyi, taught a pro-
seminar, a seminar in general church history, a two-semester
course on the Metropolitanate of Kiev and the Ukrainian-
Byelorussian Church, and a Ukrainian church history seminar for
the upper three years. Ivan Krypiakevych, another prominent lay
historian, taught general Ukrainian political history. The
metropolitan himself taught Eastern and Western ascetics. Three
courses and two seminars in Church Slavonic were taught along
with Greek and Hebrew. Volodymyr Zalozets'kyi taught Byzantine
and Ukrainian art history; another lay authority, Iaroslav Pasternak,
lectured on archaeology. Courses on anthropology and the history of
music were offered in addition to the more traditional subjects. 217
Academy training was not purely theoretical, for each fourth
and fifth-year student had to prepare and deliver one sermon. A
student who had mastered the required subjects could pursue other
interests that could be useful in his priestly work, and in general the
academy sought to introduce all seminarians to areas of knowledge
beyond the basic curriculum. 218
An academy required an ample library. Although a Soviet
source presumably having access to seminary records claims that
the library had only about 1,000 books, 219 an émigré work states that
there were over 12,000. 220 Students were expected to procure their
own textbooks, though they could not obtain other types of books or
subscribe to periodicals without the rector's permission. 221
Extra-curricular activities were a prominent feature of
seminary life both before and after the L'viv seminary reform and
subsequent expansion, and at Peremyshi' as well. The seminary
rules at L'viv allowed free time after dinner until two o'clock,
between 4:00 and 4:45, and then from supper until 8:30. Seminarians

could walk in the garden, converse, play chess, volley-ball or bowls, or
read. 222 One seminarian of the 1930s spent his free time learning
wood-carving and inlay work. 223 There was organised group activity
as well. A musical club had a chorus and orchestra, and staged
comic reviews satirising prefects, faculty and even the rector. 224
Probably the oldest group at L'viv was the Brotherhood of the
Presentation of the Virgin, founded by the Rev. Isydor Dol'nyts'kyi in
1885 and still active in the 1930s, which enjoyed special indulgences
as well as its own chapel. 225 A Marian Sodality was organised in
1913 as a section of this brotherhood. 226 The "Reading-room" Society,
founded in 1849, possessed a library of 1,132 volumes in 1898, the
largest category of which was Ruthenian and Russian belles-lettres.
227 After a period of apathy, the "Reading-room of Ruthenian-
Ukrainian Seminarians" was revived in 1902. About the same time,
Russophile students formed a "Circle of Russian Students of the
Faculty of Theology," which organised an evening programme in
honour of Pushkin but was soon closed down by the administration
for its overtly pro-Russian views. A quarterly journal called
Katolytskyi Vskhid ("The Catholic East") was founded. The Slavic
Circle, which had foundered in the pre-reform years, was revived
and became particularly active in1905. Its members corresponded
with seminarians in Transcarpathia, Bukovyna, and Russian
Ukraine, and even hosted a delegation of Transcarpathian
Ruthenians. Among their aims was to raise the national
consciousness of these groups. The Slavic Circle also maintained
contacts with Czech and Slovenian seminarians. 228
In order to increase their contacts with the popular masses,
the L'viv seminarians organised an "Enlightenment Committee" in
1908, which sent its members to give talks at reading-rooms in the
area. This committee became the "Enlightenment Circle," and
around 1908-1909, with the decline of the Slavic Circle and the journal
Katolytskui Vsk hid, it became a focus of extra-curricular activity. In
their expeditions to the countryslde the seminarians came up

against the anti-clerical efforts of secular enlighteners, but also
gained the approval of the Prosvit p ('Enlightenment") organisation
and at least some of the press. 229 They set up reading-rooms and
agricultural societies -- good preparation for their future social
activism as parish priests. They also worked with neglected children,
and prided themselves on preserving them from Polish influences.
230
Although a Theological Circle was still functioning in 1913,
other groups, like the temperance and literary societies, languished
in the first decade and a half after the seminary reform. 231 The
Theological Circle was re-organised as the "Theological Scholarly
Society of Ukrainian Seminarians in L'viv," and published an
almanac in 1914. 232 Around this time the temperance and literary
circles were revived, and a sports club was begun. After student
participation in the Vienna Eucharistic Congress in September 1912,
there was a rebirth of spiritual life, and the Markiian Shashkevych
memorial reading room was founded. Its members arranged
subscriptions to German and Polish theological journals and gave
charity benefit concerts. 233
The Brotherhood of the Presentation, the Enlightenment
Reading-room and a number of cooperative, temperance, and other
circles within the seminary gave the students a taste of the
Ukrainian organisational life in which they would be expected to
participate as priests. 234 In one form or another, these groups
continued at L'viv after the first world war. In addition, the seminary
chorus became well known throughout Galicia, and in the 1930s it
toured the province. Its audiences occasionally included noted
composers such as Liudkevych and Barvins'kyi. 235 Organising the
seminary orchestra was more difficult, however; instruments which
had been used by the Sich Sharpshooters in the war had to be
borrowed from the Lysenko Musical Institute. 236

Jubilees were an important feature of Ruthenian and
Ukrainian culture, and the Lviv seminarians organised or
participated in a number of celebrations of events deemed significant
by Church and society. Among these were the centennial of the birth
of the Rev. Markiian Shashkevych, a writer, member of
the"Ruthenian Triad" and popular enlightener, in 1911; the lGOOth
anniversary of the Edict of Milan and the 300th of the death of
Metropolitan Ipatii Potii, an initiator of the Union of Brest, in 1913;
and, in 1937, the 300th anniversary of the death of Metropolitan losyf
Veliamyn Ruts'kyi, an advocate of Uniate-Orthodox union, and the
centenary of the publication of Rusalka Dnistrova, a collection of
Ruthenian folklore among the publishers of which was the Rev.
Shashkevych. 237
At the Peremyshl' seminary, extra-curricular activity was less
developed. The absence of any organisations at that seminary until
the appearance of the "Scholarly Circle" in 1922 may be explained by
the fact that this had not been a full four-year seminary until the
preceding year, and that fourth-year students generally had the least
amount of free time; furthermore, as long as there was only a fourth-
year class there, the next class to arrive each year would have lost
touch with its predecessor due to their physical separation, virtually
foreclosing continuity in the work of any student organisations. 238
The members of the "Scholarly Circle" pursued theology,
contemporary literature, and the propagation of the Ukrainian
language. In the year of its founding, the Circle had a library of 25
books, and presented seven lectures, mostly on practical subjects. In
the following year, about 100 books were acquired. Subscriptions were
opened to several secular and theological journals. Work began on
an almanac, which was published on the 300th anniversary of the
death of St. Josaphat Kuntsevych (considered the chief Ruthenian
Uniate martyr), in 1923. In 1923-1924 the Scholarly Circle organised
lectures on such diverse subjects as medicine, icons, and charitable
work in the villages. Later lectures concerned topics ranging from
autocephaly to bee-keeping. About this time a museum was also set
up, on the initiative of the rector, the future bishop Rev. Hryhorii

Lakota. In the latter half of the 1920s, however, the society declined,
because of the lack of seminarians in the wake of the introduction of
compulsory priestly celibacy in 1925 (see below, and Chapter Four,
Section 1). In 1927-1928 the society gave no lectures, but spent 29 zloty
on books, and donated 10 zloty to the Prosvita society and five zloty for
political prisoners. After this, there began a period of renewal of the
Scholarly Circle. 239 The group was still active in 1937. 240 A
cooperative of theology students seems to have existed at Peremyshi'
too, and in 1937 the seminarians published another almanac. 241
The academic level at Peremyshi' is described by several of its
graduates who attended in the l930s as good or satisfactory. 242 One
graduate complains, however, that church history was taught
separately from the history of the people, and that altogether there
was too little patriotic education, with a lack of jubilee celebrations
and special lectures. He also criticises the absence of foreign
anguages in the curriculum, and the superficial treatment of canon
law. Finally, he feels that there was too little practical education --
though another graduate says the opposite. 243 Another finds the
level high, and recalls that the programme was demanding. 244
Two Peremyshi' graduates of the 1930s recall that discipline
was harsh; one of them characterises this as a Latin-style
innovation. He states that seminary life was based on the monastic
system, with seminarians sleeping in ten- to twelve-bed dormitories
in the first two years and rising at 5:30. Holidays were limited to two
months in the summer. Generally, discipline as described by this
individual resembles that prevailing in L'viv. 245 The other graduate
recalls that the seminary administration showed a lack of trust in
the students, relying instead on harsh methods and constant
surveillance. There was a lack of recreational activities. He also
observes that during the summer holidays, the seminarians were
given too little to do by their parish priests, their duties usually being

limited to serving at the liturgy; Polish priests, by contrast, were
more demanding in this respect. 246
There is little information available about the Stanyslaviv
seminary. Hostile accounts focus on the controversy surrounding the
introduction of compulsory priestly celibacy in that eparchy in 1920,
and even a most sympathetic biography of Bishop Khomyshyn of
Stanyslaviv, whose long tenure (1904-1945) saw the establishment of
his diocesan seminary in 1907, limits the discussion of priestly
education almost entirely to the celibacy issue. 247 (This issue will be
discussed below and in Chapters Four and Seven.) Several memoirs,
however, provide a fragmentary picture of life in the Stanyslaviv
seminary. 248
Like their precedessors. the over 30 students accepted in the
first year in 1906 were sent to the L'viv seminary from the Stanyslaviv
eparchy to take courses at the University, but after the Christmas
holidays became the first entering class at the new Stanyslaviv
seminary. Their rector was a Basilian monk, Rev. Ieremiia
Lomnyts'kyi. 249 By 1922-1924, the number of seminarians at
Stanyslaviv was 140.250
As in the L'viv seminary, young men entered the seminary at
Stanyslaviv for a number of reasons besides some sense of vocation.
The Rev. Petro Mel'nychuk, ordained in 1928, began his university
studies at the secret Ukrainian university in L'viv in1922. GIven the
uncertain conditions of the times he and a few friends decided to
study theology at Stanyslaviv, since admission to the other Greek-
Catholic seminaries was closed. Although Bishop Khomyshyn
seemed displeased that the youths were applying to his seminary in
the middle of the academic year and only as a last resort, he accepted
them. 251
In the first years after World War I, material conditions were
about as dlfficult in Stanyslaviv as at L'viv and Peremyshi'.
Mel'nychuk mentions that many of the students were war veterans
who were poor and lacked appropriate clothing. Students received no

money from the state. The seminary food was insufficient, the rooms
were cold, and there was a lack of fuel. 252 In addition, seminary life
was intentionally hard. A seminarian of 1923-1925 who left over the
celibacy issue recalls that the rigorous discipline helped to build
spiritual life. Upon being awakened by the bell in the morning,
seminarians had to maintain silence in the halls on their way to the
chapel, where they would spend an hour on their knees in meditation
on the subjects presented to them by the spiritual father on the
previous evening. Next came a liturgy, and it was only after another
ten minutes of thanksgiving in the chapel that the students could
proceed to the refectory for a rather modest breakfast and the day's
first opportunity to converse. After lectures and dinner there was
time for chess, billiards, discussions, jokes and anecdotes, followed by
a one-hour walk beyond the town limits. There followed more
lectures, study time, supper, and the presentation of topics for the
next morning's meditation. 253
Under the rectorship of the Rev. Lomnyts'kyi, Bishop
Khomyshyn, who as rector at L'viv in 1902-1904 was familiar with
Sheptyts'kyi s reform, assembled a distinguished faculty including
the Basilian Tyt Halushchyns'kyi, the Basilian and future bishop of
Peremyshl' losafat Kotsylovs'kyi, the future bishops Ivan
Liatyshevs'kyi and Nykolai Charnets'kyi, and the Rev. Iakiv
Medvets'kyi, future Apostolic Administrator for the Lemko region.
Bishop Khomyshyn paid close attention to the seminary and
students, all of whom he knew personally, and frequently attended
their leisure activities to converse with them. 254 Considered by the
Rev. Mel'nychuk to have been both demanding and dedicated, Bishop
Khomyshyn lectured at the seminary every evening. 255

Ruthenian Provincial Synod of 1891 and continued with Metropolitan
