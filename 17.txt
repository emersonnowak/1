
Catholic priests were heavily involved in helping to organise various
lay societies, such as the Apostolate of Prayer, Marian Sodalities, and
Catholic Action. 519 Much of this involved social and political issues,
so that it was difficult to distinguish pastoral from socio-political
activity. 520 A significant portion of the parish clergy in the
countryside, however, reacted with passive resistance to these
organisational novelties, which disrupted the traditional style of
pastoral work.52'
The pastoral activity of the Greek-Catholic clergy was on the
whole similar to that of the Latin-rite priests. They followed Latin
models of spiritual life, and like their Polish fellow-priests
experienced a revival of pastoral work in the 1930s. Among the
organisations they helped form was the Brotherhood of the Most Holy
Sacrament in L'viv, and the Apostolate of Prayer; the latter existed in
over half the parishes of the Stanyslaviv eparchy. Church
brotherhoods and temperance societies were also common.522
The Apostolate of Prayer, founded in southern France in 1844,
had reached Polish lands in 1871. It was strongest in the Austrian
partition, existing in almost every parish. In the 1930s the Apostolate
experienced a rapid development, counting some 750,000 members
throughout Poland in 1936. It was directed by the Jesuits. In each
diocese, the Apostolate was under the jurisdiction of the bishop-
ordinary, who appointed a diocesan director. On the parish level, it
was the parish priest who supervised its activity. The devotional
practices were simple, focusing on offering oneself to the Heart of
Jesus. However, the concept of dedicating one's entire life and
activity to Christ, combined with monthly intentions prescribed in
Rome, sometimes involved members in social and political issues;
thus, in March 1933 the Apostolate opposed communism and
plutocracy, in October 1936 it assailed Freemasonry, and in February
1938 it denounced Godless communism. The Apostolate of Prayer
has been described as a means for the clericalisation of social life,

and the clergy have been accused of using such devotional groups to
mobilise religious feelings for political aims.523
The Greek-Catholic Church devoted much attention to the use
of lay organisations in pastoral work. 524 Brotherhoods, which
enjoyed a venerable tradition in the East Slavic lands, continued to
play a major part in parish life. Of the modern types of lay
organisations, Catholic Action aroused considerable interest in the
1930s, though it is difficult to determine how much practical work
was actually achieved. Created in 1905 by Pope Pius X and
encouraged by Pope Pius XI, the movement represented an attempt
by the Church to break out of its isolation in response to the moral
and spiritual ruin of Europe. In September 1930 Cardinal illond
introduced Catholic Action into Poland, and a conference of bishops
meeting in L'viv in January of the following year established a
statute for the organisation in Galicia. The Polish branch of Catholic
Action was re-organised in 1934, and by 1936 claimed 519,666
members throughout Poland, mostly in the countryside. The basic
principle of Catholic Action was the cooperation of the laity with the
Church in apostolic work. While avowedly apolitical, or rather
suprapolitical, the movement aimed to increase the influence of
Christian morality on political life. 525 In a joint pastoral letter to the
clergy and laity, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and three of the Galician
bishops recommended Catholic Action as a means to save the
faithful from moral and spiritual ruin. 526 The Greek-Catholic clergy
apparently regarded the movement as a way to increase the
Church's influence in a society dominated by political parties. While
the movement transcended social and political divisions within
Ukrainian society, the Greek-Catholic variant of Catholic Action
developed independently of the Polish movement. The anti-
communist and nationalist stance of the Greek-Catholic variant
attracted the secular Ukrainian intelligentsia to what was in
principle a form of the lay apostolate. However, in a letter of October

1931 to Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, Fr. Roman Berest wrote that there
was a lack of qualified laymen, which would force the clergy to do
most of the work. Unfortunately, the clergy itself lacked enthusiasm
and organisational ability.527
In the Peremyshl' eparchy, an attempt was made to remedy
this problem. Articles were published about the Catholic Action
movement, 528 and a pastoral course on Catholic Action was held in
Peremyshl' on 4-7 September 1934. Each deanery was to send two
priests to this course, and over 115 attended. A variety of pastoral
topics was covered by nine speakers during the three-day course.529
Greek-Catholic priests in Galicia recognised that they had to
go beyond the church and the rectory in order to have sufficient
contact with the faithful. For example, in 1928 Fr. losyf Marynovych
suggested at a meeting of Peremyshl' Eparchial Aid (a priests'
society) that other points of contact such as the school, the reading-
room, and the village cooperative should be utilised. 53 Â° The meeting
decided that new pastoral methods should be discussed at deanery
meetings, that model sermons should be printed in the eparchial
bulletin and homiletic handbooks disseminated, and that the
Apostolate of Prayer should be propagated. Priests should also work
in reading-rooms and cooperatives and try to draw the intelligentsia
into activity beneficial to Church and people. 53 ' Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi,
who attended this meeting, favoured the introduction of modern
pastoral methods, and established Catholic Action in his eparchy in
1931. He also stressed the importance of the press, dedicating three or
four pastoral letters to this topic.532
In the mid-1930s the Greek-Catholic bishops called on their
clergy as well as the faithful to prepare for a struggle against the

"enemies of God" who were infiltrating social organisations and
threatening the faith. They recommended that priests and laity work
together in Catholic Action to avert the danger. 533 Yet in 1935 Fr.
Vasyl' Pryshliak, while recognising that the new "religious
offensive" would require "a new attitude of spirit, new tactics, new
armament and training" -- and a new pastoral and theological
approach -- lamented the fact that in their pastoral work, most of the
Greek-Catholic clergy had not gone beyond academic manuals and
were not interested in developing their activity in a contemporary
spirit. Catholic Action was not widely understood, and the clergy
remained in a state of incomprehensible calm, indifference, or
complacency. 534 Similar sentiments were expressed anonymously in
Nyva by a 70-year-old priest in 1934. Many priests had become
indifferent, apathetic. Their formalistic style of work resembled that
of bureaucrats, and they were not accessible to their faithful. More
active priests, on the other hand, often proved ineffective because in
the seminary they had not been prepared for practical work. This
was particularly true in Peremyshi' and Stanyslaviv. The new
German pastoral methods meant nothing to them. Meanwhile, in
the West priests were being re-educated through special pastoral
courses. Furthermore, the Greek-Catholic clergy were also falling
behind their Polish neighbours in this respect. He suggested that
rather than waiting for their superiors to remedy the situation, the
priests themselves should draw up a plan for their continuing
pastoral education. "Let us not allow the enemy to prevail with
modern weapons!"535
The need for modern pastoral methods was felt by Fr. Stefan
Hrynevets'kyi, speaking at the Iaroslav (Jaroslaw) deanery meeting
on 23 May 1939 on "The Obligations of the Pastor at the Present
Time." The priest must set an example by living a holy life, but he
must also develop his knowledge, both theological and secular. As in
the past, the Church must prove that all human knowledge can
serve to explain and defend the Catholic faith. The most important
condition of effective pastoral work, however, was familiarity with

the parish itself -- with the people, their character, their world view.
In addition to maintaining contact with parishioners through social
orgnisations, Fr. Hrynevets'kyi recommended maintaining a file of
parish statistics. This would also help him in conducting pastoral
work in the home, a technique proved effective in the West. 536 Fr. D.
Kuzmins'kyi, speaking at the Sambir deanery meeting in May of the
same year, suggested that in addition to prayer, example, and work
in religious societies, priests should obtain motion picture projectors
and tour the villages with Christian films on moral and religious
topics .537
Faced with a moral decline which they attributed to the world
war, and with social, ideological and sectarian threats to the faith,
Greek-Catholic priests of the 1930s continued to seek more effective
pastoral methods. 538 A common means to foster their flocks'
spiritual development was to organise missions by visiting monastic
preachers, typically Basilians or Redemptorists. To further the
religious education of their faithful, priests founded parish libraries,
which contained a mix of religious and secular literature. 539 A
special opportunity to raise the moral and spiritual level of the
faithful, which had strong political overtones as well, was the 950th
anniversary of the Baptism of Rus' in 1938.Â°
A separate aspect of pastoral work was familiarising the
faithful with the social doctrine of the Catholic Church. This was
especially important in Galicia, where rural poverty and, in the
1930s, urban unemployment brought about a political radicalisation
of society. In 1931, on the fortieth anniversary of the encyclical
"Rerum novarum" (and before the appearance of the encyclical letter
"Quadragesimo anno" on 15 May of that year), the Bishop of

Peremyshi' issued a letter which was to be read out by every parish
priest on one of the Sundays in May in place of a sermon.541 At a
meeting of the Stara Si!' deanery in June of 1939, the assembled
parish priests resolved to explain to their faithful the Papal
encyclicals on the social question.542
The requirement that priests concern themselves with matters
which, like the social question, lay outside the confines of traditional
pastoral duties, compelled them to "come out of the sacristy" and into
society. There they faced a bewildering variety of social, cultural and
political issues. Some of these issues will be discussed in Chapters
Six through Eight. First, however, it is necessary to survey the
clergy's social relationships beyond the sacristy.
2. Relations with the Secular Intelligentsia
By 1900, the secularisation of Ruthenian Galician society was
well under way. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi seems to have accepted
this process as natural, but felt that the Church had to retain its
position of leadership in the moral and spiritual domain. In concrete
terms this meant that some kind of accommodation would have to be
found between the clergy and the secular intelligentsia. This was not
a simple matter, however, as a significant portion of the
intelligentsia was anti-clerical. Many had come under the influence
of western European socialist ideas as transmitted by their
countrymen from Russian Ukraine such as Mykhailo Drahomanov
and Mykhailo Hrushevs'kyi, and interpreted by local intellectuals
like Ivan Franko and Mykhailo Pavlyk. Anti-clericalism led in some
cases to outright atheism. On the other hand, the persistence of
Russophile notions among the Greek-Catholic clergy alienated many
Populists who otherwise might be sympathetic to religion and the
Catholic Church. 543 Later, when the clergy generally abandoned

Rerum Novarum, see Kirwan, Joseph, trans. Rerum Novarum. London, 1983.
Some of the ideas of "Rerum Novarum" had already been transmitted through
the pastoral letters of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi which, however, were concerned
specifically with the problems of Galicia. See Krawchuk, Andrii. "Sheptytskyi
and the Ethics of Christian Social Action," in Magocsi, Paul R., ed. Morality
and Reality: the Life and Times of Andrei SheDtvts'kvi. Edmonton, Alberta,

Russophilism and gradually joined first the populist, then the
Ukrainian national movement, they were able to form a rough
coalition with the bulk of the secular intelligentsia, who for the most
part had tempered their social radicalism. Only the radical left-wing
intelligentsia on the one hand, and the radical right-wing
nationalists on the other, remained at odds with the clergy. (These
issues will be discussed in detail in Chapters Six and Seven.)
In his first pastoral letter upon assuming the episcopal see of
Stanyslaviv in 1899, Andrei Sheptyts'kyi addressed the problem of the
clergy's relations with the secular intelligentsia. Admitting that the
former were losing ground to the latter with regard to social
influence, he declared that the clergy would not try to regain the lost
ground: "The times when the priests alone represented the
Ukrainian intelligentsia are past, never to ieturn!" In matters of
faith and morals, however, they must retain their leadership of
society. Thus, the clergy were obligated to oppose the Radicals'
doctrine of atheism and the socialists' rejection of the Christian
concepts of family and property. For more and more of the
intelligentsia were becoming non-believers, or regarded Christianity
with rationalistic indifferentism, which essentially was paganism.
To convert them, wrote Bishop Sheptyts'kyi, priests must pray, but
they must also come to understand the intelligentsia and their ideas.
In conversations as well as sermons, they must set out Christian
dogmas with precision.544
One of Sheptyts'kyi's first pastoral letters upon assuming the
Metropolitanate of Halych in 1901 was directed to the Ruthenian
intelligentsia. Rejecting the notion that Christianity was a purely
private matter, he asserted that it was a norm of social life that could
play a unifying role in a society threatened by the loss of ethical
principles and divided in terms of social ideals.545

In his August, 1905 pastoral letter to his clergy, Bishop
Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv asserted that on the whole, the secular
intelligentsia remained in the Church, but had allowed itself to be
terrorised by a few Godless individuals. Most of the intelligentsia
were passive, he wrote, and not even a small group could be found
who would dedicate themselves to Christian work. Meanwhile, the
press and belles-lettres continued to assail Christian morality, the
faith, and the Church.546
The friendly social relations between the largely Old
Ruthenian or Russophile clerical caste and the secular intelligentsia
in one district of Galicia were mentioned in the previous chapter.
These of course were not universal, particularly with the growth and
increasing militancy of the populist and radical socialist movements.
An example of the sort of conflict that could arise was that which
occurred in the Lemko region in 1902 between Fr. Teofil'
Kachmarchyk, Fr. Ivanyshov and other lay and clerical Russophiles
on the one hand, and Vasyl' Iavors'kyi and Petro Linyns'kyi on the
other. The latter were government officials and deputies as well as
lay activists with a Ukrainian populist orientation, who had
organised a Ruthenian students' home in Nowy Scz for the poor,
ignorant Lemko population. Their efforts were attacked by the
Russophile priests, who reportedly called them atheists. "From
ancient times," wrote Iavors'kyi, "our Clergy has not shut itself off
from secular people with a Chinese wall, as in the West, where
'schweigt der Laie'; on the contrary, our clergy sought to join the
laity to them..." Fr. Kachmarchyk, however, had "dug a chasm
between the clerical and lay people." The lay activists wished th work
with the people, and they sought cooperation, not obstruction, from
the clergy.547
To some Polish critics of the Greek-Catholic Church, conflicts
between the emerging Ukrainian secular intelligentsia and their
clergy proved the latter's ineffectiveness. Spiritually weakened by the
Josephinist tradition, Greek-Catholic priests had little influence on

the people and none on the intelligentsia, wrote an anonymous
author in 1912. He quoted a Fr. Szczepkowicz, who had stated that the
Ruthenian intelligentsia, which opposed the clergy and Christianity
itself, were pushing the priests out of the educational and economic
institutions which the clergy had helped to found. In 1908 "Prosvita"
(the enlightenment society founded in 1868 by Greek-Catholic priest
Fr. Stepan Kachala) had published a brochure advocating free-
thinking and secular schools, and the daily newspaper "Dilo" had
demanded emancipation of school youth from religious
influences.548
In 1916, "Fr. S.M. from B." confronted the problem squarely, if
pseudonymously, in the pages of Nyva. The clergy were complaining
that the intelligentsia had become alienated from the Church,
indifferent, even hostile. However, it was the priests themselves who
were at fault, for they had failed to educate and inspire the
intelligentsia, to draw them closer to the Church. "The best proof of
this is all those members of the intelligentsia who, having married
Polish women, so readily abandon what is theirs.... Sometimes when
they enter a [Greek-Catholic] church they at times act as if they were
in a Chinese or Indian pagoda." It was not that they were atheists or
Freemasons; many, indeed, were more or less religious, and some
would defend the Church on behalf of the people. The problem was
that they did not understand the close ties between Church and
people.549
The alarm expressed by some of the Greek-Catholic parish
priests and bishops about the anti-clerical attitudes of the
intelligentsia were not greatly exaggerated. In 1921 Anton Korczok
characterised the Ukrainian Galician intelligentsia as often
indifferent to religion, opposed to the Union, and even atheistic.
Priests' sons had converted to Orthodoxy or joined the Freemasons.
The Ukrainian press was anti-religious.550
In the Peremyshl' eparchy in the 1920s some members of the
intelligentsia blamed Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi and his chosen clergy for

the ongoing conflicts. Unlike the earlier strife in the Lemko region,
this was not a battle between Russophiles and populists, but
