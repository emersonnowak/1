same time in the Greek-rite tserkva and the Latin-rite k p ci&t' of a
given locality, allowing people of both rites to discuss the dangers to
the Catholic faith that threatened them all. Among other things, he
advocated reviving the custom of taking part in processions of the
other rite (such as at the Latin Corpus Christi or the Byzantine
"Jordan"), for seeing that the other rite shared the same faith and
respected one's own rite would strengthen the faith of both. Priests
should coordinate and cooperate in pastoral work. All this, wrote Fr.
Tarnawski, would bring about harmony between priests and faithful

schismatics, liberals, radicals, national democrats and socialists, had been
made earlier. Z.X.Y. Prawoslawie w Rosvi i jego todhe w Galic yi. Lw6w, 1912,

of the two rites, increasing their resistance to forces threatening
their common Catholic faith. 96
Fr. Tarnawski's high-minded propositions were not effected.
In the inter-war period the clergy of the two rites gradually ceased to
take part in each other's services. Greek-Catholic priests would on
occasion advise their faithful not to take part in Latin-rite retreats or
pilgrimages. 97 In fact, the Greek-Catholic clergy seems to have
distanced itself from the Latin-rite clergy in general. 98 Hostile
activity did not cease; dean Mykola Makar of Stara Sil' reported in
1939 that at the deanery meeting of 6 June there had been discussion
of "Pobudka," a local periodical edited by a Polish priest which
attacked the Greek-Catholic clergy.
The principal issue in inter-rite clerical relations was the
"Concordia" (as distinguished from Concordat) of 1863. This solemn
agreement between the two rites concerned various practical matters
such as change of rite, pastoral cooperation and inter-rite marriages.
To change rite, for example, a person had to apply to his bishop, who
would make the appropriate observations and pass the application to
the bishop of the other rite. The final decision would be made by the
Holy See in Rome. If a person were accepted by a priest of another
rite into that rite without following this procedure, the change of rite
would be void, and the priest would be penalised if he was aware that
the person belonged to the other rite. A priest could celebrate mass in
a church of another rite by Papal indult and with permission of the
rector. Baptism of an infant of another rite was permitted only in
emergencies or where a priest of the infant's rite could not be
reached; however, this did not bring with it a change of rite.
Ruthenian priests could not confirm a child of the Latin rite
immediately after baptism (as is the Eastern custom). The priest of
the infant's rite would have to be notified of the baptism. A priest
could hear confession and grant absolution to persons of the other

98 Of nine priests ordained in the inter-war period responding to a
questionnaire or interview question about their relations with the Polish clergy,
two replied that they had had no contact, one that he had had little, one said that
he had stayed away, one reported indifferent relations, one recalled cold but
polite relations, one cited bad relations and two reported good relations.

rite, but could not give them communion; however, extreme unction
and the viaticum could be administered to such persons if necessary.
Inter-rite marriage was not to be prevented; a priest of the wife's rite
must perform the ceremony. A child was to be raised in the rite of the
parent of its gender (i.e., a boy was to be raised in his father's rite, a
girl in her mother's). Among the exceptions to this rule were the
children of Greek-Catholic priests. Illegitimate children of either
gender followed the mother's rite. To perform a funeral of a person of
another rite, a priest needed the permission of the deceased person's
priest, but the faithful were free to bury the deceased in a cemetery of
the other rite. Provisions were made for mutual aid among priests of
different rites. 100
A letter of 28 September 1899 to the Peremyshi' episcopal
consistory from the laborurer Andrei Iurkov of Sambir illustrates
the context in which conflicts between priests of the Greek and Latin
rites frequently arose. In 1893 Iurkov, under the influence of his
Polish neighbours, had had his son baptised in the Latin rite. "But
when I recognised from the teachings of our pastors that I had done
wrong, for being a Ruthenian I should have baptised the boy in a
tserkva, I went to the Latin-rite parish priest and asked him to give
me back the birth record so that I could transfer it to my own parish
priest, that is, of the Ruthenian rite." The Latin-rite priest replied
that he would only do this if a court ordered him to. The local
government authorities would not help either. He therefore requested
the Greek-Catholic consistory to appeal to the Latin-rite consistory to
prevail upon its priest to let him have the birth certificate, "for under
no circumstances do I want my boy to be brought up in the Latin
rite." 0' In May of 1900, a Greek-Catholic priest in Krakovets' sent
the Peremyshl' episcopal ordinariat a list of 44 children of the
"Ruthenian Catholic rite" in two villages who had been improperly
baptised in the Latin rite by one Fr. Szczepko. 102 In December of 1902
100 Polish Institute, London. Collection A44 (Papée) file 122/2 (copy of Polish
translation of Concordia of 6 October 1863). Inter-rite relations were also
regulated by the Austrian law of 25 May 1868. In a report of 1 October 1929 to the
Ministry of Religious Cults and Public Education, the Stanyslaviv
(Stanisaw6w) governor argued that the Concordat of that year did not invalidate
that law, which should continue to be given effect as it was more in line with the
Polish Constitution, freedom of religion and Polish interests than the Concordia.

Fr. Pryslopskii, assistant priest in Dubets'ko on the San (Peremyshi'
eparchy), published a brochure in which he complained that in this
area of mixed population, entire villages had gone over to the Latin
rite in recent decades. Some of his Greek-Catholic faithful in
neighbouring Bakhorets', where there was only a Latin-rite priest,
Fr. Edmund Duczka, had recently left their rite. To remedy the
situation, Fr. Pryslopskii appealed for help in building a Greek-
Catholic church in Bakhorets'. 103
More complicated was the situation described by a Latin-rite
priest in Brukhnal' in the same year. There, the daughter of a Greek-
rite father and a Latin-rite mother, who for some reason had been
baptised in a Greek-rite church, but whose birth certificate had been
sent to the Latin-rite church, wished to marry a man of the Greek
rite. The Greek-Catholic priest, a Fr. Volos, insisted that she marry
in his church. The girl's parents agreed that even if she were
married in the tserkva, she would make confession and take
communion in the koci&1'. The Polish priest asked the Greek-
Catholic episcopal ordinariat in Peremyshi' to decide who was to
perform the marriage, and remarked that this was not the first
instance of proselytism on the part of Fr. Volos. 104
Since the general trend was for changes from the Greek to the
Latin rite,' 05 following the trend of assimilation of Ruthenians with
the Polish nation, the barriers to change of rite created by the
Concordia were usually favoured by the Greek-Catholic clergy, and
opposed by the Latin-rite clergy. The fact that a change of rite usually
meant a change of nationality engaged the clergy's patriotic feelings
as well. Priests of either nationality sought to reverse what they
perceived as denationalisation of their people.'° 6 In 1927 Fr. Merena,

and Polish nationality: "It must be stated that Polish culture, as a higher culture,
has more attractive force, and as a consequence the Ruthenians will have to
suffer constant sacrifices to her benefit." See also the report of 16 October 1929

dean at Ripnyk, in consenting to the transfer of a Greek-Catholic
married to a Latin-rite Catholic to his wife's rite, observed that the
pressures on a Greek-Catholic living in a Polish village would
compel him to transfer sooner or later. But he warned that this could
lead to mass transfers to the Latin Rite, especially in an irreligious
and unprincipled age. 107
In 1938 the parish priest at Vil'shanyk in the Peremyshl'
eparchy wrote to the episcopal ordinariat that laymen were being
persuaded to change rite in exchange for employment such as
roadwork or a job with the local authority or post office. He suggested
that in cases of mixed-rite couples moving to a new parish, the
Greek-rite priest of the new parish should be alerted so that he might
ensure that the Concordat was being observed with respect to the
Greek-rite partner.'°8 The clergy of the Liubachiv (Lubaczów) and
Nemyriv deaneries were so alarmed by the tide of conversions to the
Latin Rite that at their meetings of December 1938, Fr. S. Denko spoke
at the former deanery on "How to Avert Mass Transfers from our
Rite to the Latin Rite," and Fr. Iaroslav Harasym spoke at Nemyriv
on "The Luring of the Faithful into the Roman-Catholic Rite, and
How to Defend against it." Among the measures recommended by
Fr. Harasym were education, improving ritual aesthetics, preventing
mixed-rite marriages or else requiring an oath that the children
would be baptised in the tserkva, and raising national consciousness.
109
Although the Greek-Catholic clergy appealed to the Concordia
to prohibit changes to the Latin rite, according to some Polish
sources they were as ready as Latin-rite priests to ignore the
Concordia when it came to transferring persons to the Greek rite.
Indeed, the sources are replete with mutual accusations of
duszotapstwo -- "soul-snatching." 110 The density of the Greek-

Catholic parish network did often result in Latin-rite Poles availing
themselves of the services of Greek-Catholic priests." 1 Some of the
latter engaged in "revindication of souls" even in areas of mixed rite.
Fr. Stefan Makar, assistant priest in Nove Misto, proudly reported to
the Peremyshi' episcopal consistory in December 1912 that since
Easter he had brought ten souls from the Latin .rite church to the
Greek-Catholic church -- which had enraged the local Poles. This
had also led to scenes such as that in which first-former Kasia
Halaiko, one of Fr. Makar's religion pupils, was seized "amidst
shouting and shrieking" by the Latin-rite priest and the school
director, who said she must remain in the Polish religion class. 112
Conversely, some Polish clergy favoured observance of the
Concordia. Fr. Józef Borodzicz advocated this as a measure to
prevent Orthodox schism, along with helping Greek-rite Poles return
to the Latin rite and introducing the Gregorian calendar for the
Greek-Catholics. He also called on the secular authorities to help set
up more Latin-rite parishes in Eastern Galicia. Fr. Borodzicz
predicted that some would fall into schism, where they "belonged,"
but that others would be definitively saved. 113
In October 1929 the Ternopil' (Tarnopol) governor Moszyñski
reported to the Ministry of Religious Cults that the Concordia was a
"dead letter" in his county. Latin-rite priests were taking every
opportunity to baptise children who would properly be Greek-
Catholics in the Latin rite, in violation of the Concordia, and would
fail to inform the Greek-Catholic priests, as was required in such
cases. He remarked that the higher church authorities tacitly
assented to this practice, and consequently the parish priests
remained confident that they would not be punished. The Greek-
Catholic priests behaved similarly, he continued, taking advantage of
their numerical preponderance and denser parish network, and in

some cases even of winter weather barring believers' access to a
Latin-rite priest. 114
The controversy over "soul-snatching" may have affected
relations between priests of the two rites in other matters. Before the
1920s, Greek-Catholic and Latin-rite priests had frequently
celebrated mass in each other's churches. 115 However, in his 1929
report governor Moszyi%ski noted that common services by Greek and
Latin-rite priests were only sporadic, and that any cooperation was
hard to imagine. He did remark that the Concordia's prescriptions
regarding confession, marriage, and extreme unction were
generally being observed. In some cases, priests of the two rites
helped each other, for example in funerals. However, they generally
refused to invite each other to participate in major ceremonies such
as those performed at Jordan (the Greek-Catholic Epiphany) or
Corpus Christi, or in pilgrimages. Yet he observed, significantly, that
the Latin-rite clergy would like the Greek-Catholic authorities to
compel their priests to invite them to their celebrations, and would
not refuse to invite them in return. In conclusion, Moszynski stated
that regulating the relations between priests of the two rites was a
very complicated matter, albeit one which the clergy regarded as
necessary. Since the clergy of both rites would respect the Concordia
only insofar as it coincided with their aims, only state enforcement
could put it into effect again. 116
In his memoirs Oleksander Bryk, a Ukrainian layman with
anti-Catholic as well as anti-Polish sentiments, describes a Greek-
Catholic Epiphany celebration in his boyhood village of Kolodiivka in
which the local Poles were invited to participate. The priest would
transliterate the Church Slavonic of the Gospel reading into Latin
letters for the Latin-rite priest to read out. But "our people were not
pleased with such 'wspólvcie,' because they knew where it would
end. ••"117 As will be seen in the next chapter, lay attitudes influenced
the thinking and behaviour of the Greek-Catholic clergy in a variety
of matters.

The social, economic and political changes of the period from
1900 to 1939 combined with the imposition of compulsory celibacy to
shatter the traditional way of life of a good part of the Greek-Catholic
clergy. As the priestly caste declined, its members were replaced by a
new type of priest: usually of peasant origin, often holding populist
sentiments, willing out of commitment or necessity to accept a
celibate life, consequently unburdened by family life, and in many
cases possessed of a strong vocation that entailed a willingness to
accept the harsh conditions and sacrifices of priestly life in inter-war
Galicia. Although in some ways these changes brought the Greek-
Catholic clergy closer to that of the Latin rite, the exacerbation of
national relations in the inter-war period rather increased the
distance between the two.
The relationship of the Greek-Catholic clergy towards other
ethnic groups also bears mention. Here, the usual ethnic stereotypes
came into play, particularly with regard to groups with whom the
Galician Ukrainians had little direct contact, such as the Germans
and the Russians. The clergy's attitude towards the Jews poses a
special problem, for although Galicia had a heavy Jewish population
which performed important economic functions, this population
lived in considerable isolation. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi took a warm
interest in the Galician Jews, and favoured them so much that he
found it necessary to justify his attitude before society. During World
War II, he would save the lives of many. 118 There seems to be little
reason to suppose that the attitude of the Greek-Catholic clergy
towards the Jews differed from that of Ruthenian-Ukrainian society
in general, and after World War I clerical attitudes probably were
identical to peasant attitudes, since the peasantry provided the bulk of
priestly vocations. 119 Overly vague as the term may be, some kind of
"anti-Semitism" did apparently exist in Galicia, but the attitude of
the Christian population towards the Jews can best be described as
ambivalent. 120 Before World War I, anti-semitism was fomented by
118 Redlich, Shimon. "Sheptytskyi and the Jews During World War II,' in
Magocsi, 148-151. The essay briefly describes the Metropolitan's pre-war
relations with the Jews.

some politicians, particularly populists, for their own purposes; this
foreshadowed the militant anti-Semitism of national socialism after
the war. It was sometimes propagated by priests and teachers,
though ultimately the ones to act upon its implications were the
peasants.'21 In the city of L'viv, growing anti-Semitism sparked the
growth of Jewish nationalism, in the form of Zionism, in the 1880s.
The "economic crusade" of non-Jewish nationalists, involving
boycotts of Jewish merchants, was seen as a threat to the Jewish
community there.'22 In the countryside, the stereotype of the Jewish
merchant, bailiff or tavern-keeper who exploited the peasantry
persisted. In 1912 Fr. Roman Isaichyk, parish priest at lavornyk in
the laslo (Jaslo) deanery of the Peremyshi' eparchy, argued that he
should be allowed to serve as notary because the previous notary had
been a Jewish tavern-keeper who had exploited the peasants and sold
them liquor during civic meetings. His dean agreed.' 23 It is not
certain that such a perception of Jews was typical among the Greek-
Catholic clergy, but it was probably widespread. No doubt the memory
of Jewish opposition to the clerical temperance campaigns of the late
nineteenth century remained fresh. In any case, a reputation for
anti-semitism did arise. In 1935 Fr. Iuliian Dzerovych, reporting in
Nyva on that year's general meeting of the Society of St. Andrew,
mentioned that "when the Jews defamed our Greek-Catholic clergy
in English Judophile periodicals, [claiming that] it had taken part in
anti-semitic actions in Galician Ukraine, our Society raised a
work, at pp. 2 15-239, and Mendelsohn, Ezra. "Interwar Poland: Good for the Jews
or Bad for the Jews?" in Abramsky, Chimen; Jachimczyk, Maciej; and

finds that anti-Semitism was weak in the kresv or borderlands of Poland, where
the economy was weak and the Jews numerous. Id. 136. See also Golczewski,

Alfred Nossig." The Slavonic and East EuroDean Review vol. XLIX no. 117
(October 1971), 521-534. It should be noted, however, that the ultimate goals of
Jewish and non-Jewish nationalists did not conflict, since the latter sought to
build national states, while the Zionists sought to create a Jewish state in
Palestine. Indeed, both Zionists and anti-Semites agreed on the need for Jewish
emigration.

PART ONE: THE EDUCATION OF
THE GREEK-CATHOLIC CLERGY
CHAPTER ONE: SCHOOL AND SEMINARY
Some of the oldest Greek-Catholic priests alive in 1900 would
have attended primary and secondary school in the 1830s or 1840s,
and completed seminary in the 1850s. A priest ordained in the year
1900 typically would have been born around 1875, and attended
primary school in the earlyl88Os, a g ymnasium in the late 1880s and
early 1890s, and seminary in the middle and late 1890s. If he were
still alive in 1939, he would have been among the oldest Greek-
Catholic priests of that time. A priest ordained in 1939 typically would
