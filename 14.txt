opening of the event on Saturday, 6 May, Bishop Buchko expressed
his joy that they had overcome all obstacles to come to L'viv. On the
next day a mass was celebrated, a message from the Pope was read
out, and the participants took an oath of fidelity to Christ. An attempt
by the Communist Youth League to hand out leaflets was quickly
foiled. A massive march proceeded past a dais before St. George's
Cathedral, where Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi blessed the crowd. At a
programme held that evening at the Great Theatre, a choir sang the
Papal hymn in Italian, and the student R. Montsibovych, remarking
that paganism was now being re-born in the form of fanatical
nationalism, called upon Ukrainians to stand up in the battle against
paganism.
According to one account, the OUN's opposition to the
"Ukrainian Youth for Christ" rally resulted from the organisers'
refusal to retract an invitation to representatives of the Polish state
authorities and the Polish episcopate to sit in the "honorary
presidium." Thus, the conflict is described as political, not
religious. 795 Whatever the case may have been, what is significant
here is that in the struggle between the clergy and the OT.JN activists
to win the loyalty of Ukrainian Galician youth, in this instance the
clergy clearly won.

autumn of 1930, he would not have invited Polish representatives to the event. He
also notes that Bishop Buchko later wrote to Mirchuk, protesting against this
false explanation. Dobrians'kyi, 66.

Nevertheless, it was also clear that the clergy's role as leaders
of the people was being challenged directly. In order to maintain
their lead, they would have to mobilise the laity towards a
programme of social action offering a real alternative to the
nationalist programme. There was of course a danger of involving
the Church in politics. If the nationalists insisted on characterising
religious activities as political, as in the "Youth for Christ" affair,
this could hardly be avoided. Indeed, during this time religious
matters were becoming politicised, while with the growth of
mystical-revolutionary nationalism, politics was becoming
spiritualised. The clergy would have to find a way to lead the people
towards spiritual goals that transcended the political goals towards
which the radical nationalists were beckoning.
One answer was to found a Ukrainian Catholic organisation
that could influence public, especially political life. In October 1930,
with the Galician Ukrainians frightened and demoralised by the
brutal "pacification" in the countryside, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi
prompted several lay and clerical leaders, including Rev. Petro
Holyns'kyi and Rev. losyf Rakovs'kyi, to organise the Ukrainian
Catholic People's Party. The Party would disseminate Catholic social
teaching, advocating social harmony in a corporative social
structure, and opposing the notion of class struggle. On 22 October
1930 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi declared the need for a Ukrainian
Christian organisation maintaining a position of legality vis a vis the
state while seeking to develop Ukrainian culture, education,
prosperity and civil rights. Members would be free in matters of
political activity as long as they acted according to Catholic faith and
morals. This declaration was republished in March of the following
year as the programme of the new Ukrainian Catholic Union in its
organ, the newspaper "Meta." 796 To these were added the Catholic
Action movement (see Chapter FIve) and the Catholic Action of
796 "Meta" (L'viv) year I, no. 1 (15 March 1931), P. 1. Originally it had been
published in the L'viv secular daily "Dilo" on 26 October 1930. The Union was
founded at a meeting on 1 January 1931. "Meta" was edited by Rev. Petro
Khomyn, later editor of Nyva. In 1932 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, stating that the
idea of a "Catholic political party" was a contradiction in terms, reaffirmed that
the Ukrainian Catholic Union was not a political organisation. Politics meant
controversy, whereas the Party's goals were not controversial among the
Ukrainians, who supported them unanimously -- though "others," who might not
agree with these goals, could consider them "political." Andrei, Mytropolyt.

Ukrainian Youth. The Catholic activist Volodymyr Detsykevych
allegedly told Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi that all the bishops and
prominent priests had joined in the work of the Ukrainian Catholic
Union.797
To some Polish observers, the Greek-Catholic clergy was
excessively nationalistic. Henryk Ignacy Lubieiski remarked in 1934
that he doubted that the Galician Ukrainians felt much sympathy for
the Uniates of Kholm (Chem) who had suffered persecution in
connection with the imposition of Orthodoxy by Russia in 1875,
especially those who had joined the Latin rite after the Edict of
Toleration of 1905. The reason was that these Uniates had become
Poles, whereas if they had converted to Orthodoxy they might still
have become Ukrainians. To the Greek-Catholic clergy, wrote
Lubienski, the plight of these ex-Uniates was not nearly as important
as the Austrian persecution of the Orthodox just before and during
World War One. As a result of nationalist antagonisms, the Uniate
tradition had lost its most important values; indeed, Ruthenian
nationalism sometimes portrayed the Union itself as a Polish-Roman
intrigue. Greek-Catholic priests feared latinisation; some
complained of Polish influence in the Roman Curia. Nationalism,
characterised by a hatred of Poland, had ruined the Uniate traditions
and strengthened those of Orthodoxy. 798 Lubieiiski continued:
In such a state of affairs it is not strange that
the Church, the sacristy, the rectory, and even
the pulpit and the confessional often are
becoming a point of support or a site of militant
nationalism; that acts of violence, sabotage and
terror have been accepted by the broad masses of
the clergy not only in silence, but even with their
moral ratification; that in relation to the
elemental power represented by nationalism,
Catholicism can barely vegetate; that
nationalism is creating a chasm between Greek
and Latin Catholicism which is a threat to the
unity of the Catholic Church and to the idea of
this Church's universality.799

December 1934), 546-549.
Lubietiski 552-553.
249
As an example of nationalism amongst the Greek-Catholic
clergy, Lubieiiski cited the fact that the clergy of the Stanyslaviv
eparchy silently acquiesced or even took part in the campaign
against their Bishop. In Lubietcski's view, Bishop Khomyshyn
desired to take nationalism in a new direction, one in accord with the
teaching of Christ.800
Some Greek-Catholic parish priests did sense the tendency of
politics, including nationalist politics, to overshadow their work. On
14 October 1936 Rev. Roman Starodub spoke at the Bukova deanery
meeting (Peremyshi' eparchy) on the topic 'How Should one Strive to
Revive and Uplift Practical Religiosity in the Parish?" Approved by
the priests in attendance, who resolved to be guided by it in their
pastoral work, the talk enumerated, among the various ills of the age,
Bolshevism and "extreme national chauvinism."801
At the meeting of the Korosno (Krosno) deanery of 24 June
1937, Rev. Aleksii Bilevych spoke on the theme "A Popular [narodnal
or a Catholic [soborna] Church?" He criticised nationalism for
putting the nation above all other things, including faith and
religion, as in Germany. This attitude, he added, could be found
among Ukrainians too. Although nationalism in the sense of a love
for one's people was good, the love of God must come first. The
nationalists, however, put the nation before God, and sought to make
the Church "narodna." Orthodoxy could be seen as a "Greek national
schism" resulting from excessive national pride. Complaints about
"latinisation" and "polonisation" were merely rationalisations for
church populism. Rev. Bilevych stated that the Church of Christ
could not be "narodna," for the teaching of Christ is for all nations. It
is a supra-national, catholic (soborna) Church. In fact, as an
international phenomenon it coincides with Communism, and for
this reason the Hitlerites accuse the Catholic clergy of communist
sympathies. Of course, the Church respects national cultures and
national rights. It even develops patriotism among the faithful.
However, it develops a patriotism that "rests on higher foundations
that those of the nationalists -- for [it rests] upon the Lord God."
Unlike a national Church, the Catholic Church wisely reconciles a
people's eternal interests with its secular interests. Thus, the
800   Lubiercski 553.
801   WAP-P, AAL 39, pp. 56-58.
250
Church not only leads the people to eternal life, but teaches it a
healthy patriotism and nationalism which proceed from the faith
and the Commandments. By contrast false nationalism -- that is,
nationalism without God -- leads to Communism. In the discussion
following Fr. Bilevych's talk, Rev. Mykhailo Tsolta remarked that the
foundation of nationalism was materialism. The dean, Rev. Kiufas,
added that a national Church could not be "soborna" ("catholic"),
because it did not satisfy man's spiritual needs.802
At the meeting of the Zhukotyn deanery of 1 June 1939 Rev.
Teodor Boiko predicted that the Boshevik and nationalist camps
would arise among the Ukrainian people "as nowhere else. " "Our
task, therefore, is through hard work not only to paralyse all
influences of Bolshevism and atheism in the national camp, but also
to cleanse the national camp itself from the fatal tenets of modern
times." This could only be done by reviving the apostolic spirit of the
early Christians.803
The outbreak of war a few months later cut short the evolution
of Greek-Catholic clerical thought on the question of nationalism as
an ideology, as well as the development of relations between the
clergy and the secular nationalist intelligentsia. Thus, neither the
ideological conflict nor the practical question of cooperation or
competition between the two groups was ever resolved.
3. The Clerical Vanguard
It does appear that at least some Greek-Catholic parish priests
had a strong sense of mission. "A new Christian age is being created
before our very eyes, and it is being created by enthusiastic labourers,
apostles of the Kingdom of Christ," wrote Rev. Vasyl' Pryshliak in
Nyva in 1935.804 At a meeting of the Ukrainian Catholic Union in
1934, another priest stated that "We are the vanguard of Catholic
Europe." 805 In February of that year a priest writing anonymously in
802     WAP-P, AAL 40, PP. 25-30. See also Chapter Six, Part 2.

deanery of the L'viv archeparchy, was born in 1890 and ordained as a married
man in 1920. Shematyzm dukhovenstva l'vivs'koi arkhieDarkhii 1935-1936.

251
Nyva proposed as a goal of the Greek-Catholic clergy "to seek all
possible ways by which we can revive today's paganised world."806
Whatever might be the special mission of the Greek-Catholic
clergy, it required a special type of individual. According to "a young
priest" writing in "Nova Zoria" in 1927, "today the spirit of the age
requires a type of priest different from those of several decades ago."
To produce this new type of priest was the task of the seminaries.
"Today a priest is expected to come to the village with total initiative
with regard to all manifestations of social life." Among other things,
the priest had to be familiar with the aims of his Church's
enemies. 807 Such a new type of clergy could in fact be regarded as a
new elite. Based on the philosophical writings of Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi and forming an important part of the nationalist
philosophy, there arose in Ukrainian Galician society the concept of
Ukrainian elitism and even messianism, in which the central role
was to be played by the Greek-Catholic clerical elite.808
If the clerical elite was to provide leadership for Ukrainian
society, whether as an alternative to the nationalist vanguard or in
cooperation with it, it had to point toward a concrete goal. Such a goal
was provided by the ideal of Union. Insofar as Union meant the
unification of all Ukrainians in a single Church, it was in harmony
with two goals of Ukrainian nationalism: the creation of a single
Ukrainian state, and the defeat of atheistic Communism. The
broader understanding of Union, for example as envisaged by
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, meant the eventual merger of the Catholic
and Orthodox Churches and the conversion of the peoples of the
Soviet Union. It involved the creation of a Russian and a Belorussian
Catholic Church of the eastern rite -- a task begun by Sheptyts'kyi
during his sojourn in Russia in 1914-1917, and one obviously favoured
by Rome, particularly after the prophecies of Fatima.
The goal of church Union extended the parish priest's
horizons well beyond the parish. Citing a "secret" pastoral letter of
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi addressed to his clergy and dated 9
December 1917, Edward Prus claims that the Metropolitan saw the

252
Austro-German offensive of that year as an opportunity for the
Greek-Catholic clergy (presumably referring to those serving as
chaplains in the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen) to carry the missionary
work of Union into Russia. 809 The Rules of the L'viv theological
seminary stated explicitly that the Ukrainan clergy had the special
responsibility to carry out the will of Pope Urban VIII, 'per vos mei
Rutheni Orientem convertendum spero." The Rules also stated that
they must be ready for self-denial and sacrifice. 810 At the very
beginning of his reign as Metropolitan, Andrei Sheptyts'kyi had
called upon his priests to prepare for a sacrifice of blood.81'
It was thus only natural that the Greek-Catholic clergy's sense
of mission should often be expressed in martial terms. In his 1905
pasthral letter to the clergy of the Stanyslaviv eparchy on the activity
of priests, Bishop Khomyshyn berated them for their worldly ways,
lamenting the lack of "souls strongly tempered for holy battle."812
After 1917, the militant anti-religious policy of the Bolsheviks and, in
the late 1930s, the atmosphere of impending war, rendered the
possibility of self-sacrifice altogether likely and the martial metaphor
all too appropriate. In the introduction to the 1937 student almanac of
the Peremyshl' seminary, the editors wrote that "we live on the
borderlands of the Catholic Church along which, like the first
columns of soldiers on the front, we struggle in direct conflict with
hellish enemies, in order to hold the Church's positions." 813 Rev.
Shranakh of the Peremyshl' eparchy, speaking at Dobrohostiv on 29
November 1934 on the subject of Catholic Action, elaborated the
metaphor:

Let every pastor remember that he becomes a
general who must train soldiers who, under the
banner of Christ and in the name of His lofty
ideas, would go boldly and bravely to battle and
victory to win humanity for the Kingdom of
Christ.814
In his talk before the Zhukotyn deanery meeting cited above,
Rev. Teodor Boiko said that at a time when "we stand on the
threshold of great changes, and at the same time perhaps of great
ruin and destruction, we priests, as almost the sole leaders of the
people, have the weighty responsibility to arm the people
spiritually." 815 Looking back on the inter-war period, one author has
called the graduates of the L'viv academy the "vanguard" which
would break down the wall between the Christian East and West.816
Thus, at a time of feverish nationalism and anticipation of war
in the East, the Greek-Catholic clergy offered Ukrainian society a
vision of reconciliation between East and West through a Union of
Churches, expressed in martial images. At the same time it
presented a Catholic alternative to the nationalist and communist
ideologies. In doing so, it made its bid to regain the leadership of
Ukrainian Galician society as a new clerical elite, wavering between
competition and cooperation with the Ukrainian secular
intelligentsia.

CONCLUSION
The Transformation of the Greek-Catholic Clergy in
Galicia
Most of the conclusions reached in this dissertation confirm
common views. Between 1900 and 1939, the Old Ruthenian tendency
dwindled to extinction in most of Galicia, although in an unexpected
way the Russophile and Orthodox motifs would later be taken up
with the formal absorption of the Greek-Catholic Church by the
Russian Orthodox Church in 1946. The Greek-Catholic clergy
became almost solidly Ukrainian in national orientation, and for the
most part moderately nationalist in political sympathies. It remained
divided, however, between the Byzantinist and the Westernising (or
latinising) tendencies, with the former predominating. Less familiar
is its attitude towards secular culture, which in some cases was
ambiguous but which on the whole involved a ready adoption of the
version of Ukrainian history and culture being put forward by the
national intelligentsia. In adopting this version, the clergy to some
extent resolved, to some extent ignored certain apparent problems
and contradictions arising from a strictly Catholic point of view.
The common view that the Greek-Catholic clergy cooperated
with the secular nationalist movement, although generally true,
requires some refinement. There seems little support for the notion,
advanced by Soviet historiography, that the clergy uniformly
supported the radical nationalists. As has been seen, not only the
episcopate but a number of parish priests could not reconcile
ideological Ukrainian nationalism (integral nationalism) with
Christian ethics. On the other hand, a more moderate kind of
nationalism appears to have found almost universal support among
the Greek-Catholic clergy. Nevertheless, while the parish priests
may not have been concerned with theoretical inconsistencies
between religion and nationalism, and could work with the village
intelligentsia, the ultimate conflict in values and the question of
social leadership were never resolved. The events of the war and the
liquidation of the Church in 1945-1946 froze the status quo of 1939.
In view of wartime and post-war events, the ideal of Union has
been obscured. As has been seen, it became an important element in
the developing "mentality" of the Greek-Catholic clergy in Galicia,
255
due in great part to the ecumenical guidance of Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi. His vision of church Union, extending beyond the
horizons of contemporary nationalism, was grasped by few and
certainly went beyond the concerns of the average parish priest.
However, it did animate some seminary graduates. Although the
events of both world wars at first seemed to open up possibilities for
Union work, in the event this ideal was frustrated by post-war
fortunes. Just as a number of issues debated during the period under
study were never resolved, so the process of the transformation of the
Greek-Catholic parish clergy was never completed. Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi's educational reforms had little time to bear fruit. The
consequences of compulsory clerical celibacy could never be studied
under normal conditions. The ideal of a clerical vanguard prepared
to lead Ukrainian society at home and spread the Union abroad
remained largely an ideal, though one of which many clerics were
vividly conscious.
However, the metamorphosis of the Greek-Catholic priesthood
did prepare it for the trials predicted by Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi,
Bishop Khomyshyn and other leaders. The clergy of 1945-1946 was
well prepared to endure the hardships of arrest, exile, persecution
and the life of a catacomb Church. In large measure, the changes
that took place amongst the clergy between 1900 and 1939 made
possible the survival of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church as an
illegal body for 43 years.
NOTE ON SOURCES
There is no published study covering the subject of the Greek-
Catholic parish clergy from 1900 to 1939. F.I. Titov's detailed (if
opinionated) eyewitness description of this group as it existed at the
begining of the period, Russkoe dukhovenstvo v Galitsii (Kiev, 1903),
unfortunately has not been complemented by later accounts.
However, a number of published works deal with related subjects, in
particular with the Greek-Catholic Church during this period.
A useful survey of post-war Polish historiography on the
Second Republic was published in volume LXIX of Przegld
Historvcznv in 1978 by Andrzej Garlicki, Tomasz Nacz, and
Wiesaw Wladyka. According to this article, the most fertile research
on inter-war Poland had been conducted in the 1960s, with Wieslaw
MysFek producing notable studies of the Catholic Church. The only
significant work concerning the Greek-Catholic Church between
1900 and 1939 to have been produced in Poland since 1978 is Edward
Prus' polemical but informative study of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi
(W}advka witojurski, 1985). However, the article by Fr. Tadeusz
liwa on the Greek-Catholic Church in the inter-war period which
appeared in the collection KoScio1 w II Rzeczvpospolitej, published in
1980 at the Catholic University of Lublin under the editorship of
Zygmunt Zielii'iski and Stanisaw Wilk, summarises a good deal of
basic information. Also worthy of mention is Andrzej Ziba's
detailed and objective review article of Prus' work, in Kwartalnik
Historvcznv (1986).
Soviet studies of the Greek-Catholic Church, among which
S.T. Danylenko's Dorohoiu han'bv i zrady ("By the Road of Shame
and Treason," Kiev, 1970) and Klym Dmytruk's Pid shtandartamy
reaktsii i fash yzmu (Kiev, 1976) can be regarded as typical, can be
informative but, as these titles suggest, are so polemical as to be of
little value in terms of analysis.
The work of Ukrainian emigre authors has mostly focused on
the person of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi (Baran, Doroshenko,
Korolevskij, Laba, Prokoptschuk) and to a lesser extent on that of his
bishops (Mel'nychuk, Nazarko). Some of these tend to the panegyric
or the eulogy.
257
Recent western works such as John-Paul Himka's studies of
the national movement in nineteenth and early twentieth-century
Galicia, and the collection Morality and Reality, on Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi (Paul R. Magocsi, editor; Edmonton, 1989) throw some
light on the life of the clergy. With regard to approach and analysis,
Gregory Freeze's studies of the Russian Orthodox parish clergy in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (1977, 1983) have served as a
partial model for this dissertation as well as a basis for comparison.
Considerable insight into the developing mentality of the
Greek-Catholic parish clergy is provided by works published by the
priests themselves during the period under study (e.g., Rev. Havryil
Kostel'nyk). Among these are polemical pamphlets (Korytko,
Pryslopskii, Stefanovych). Those written by Polish Latin-rite priests
(Borodzicz) or laymen give some idea of the atmosphere in which the
Greek-Catholic clergy lived and worked.
Although few, published memoirs by Greek-Catholic priests
concerning the period under study are invaluable. Chief among
these are the lengthy reminiscences of Rev. 0. Prystai, Rev. Fylymon
Tarnavs'kyi, and Rev. Tyt Voinarovs'kyi, as well as the shorter
wartime memoir of Rev. Petro Holyns'kyi and the seminary
reminiscences of Rev. Osyp Ostashevs'kyi and Rev. Nykolai
Voiakovs'kyi. The score or so of anthologies of articles and
reminiscences on various regions of western Ukraine published in
recent decades in the United States and Canada contain some
material on the Greek-Catholic clergy. The third volume of Svitvl'nvk
Istyny (Chicago, 1983) includes several brief memoirs on seminary
life.
Apart from monographs and articles, the prime published
source for the Greek-Catholic clergy is the schematism, a periodical
(usually annual) directory of the parishes and clergy of a given
eparchy (diocese). Schematisms for the L'viv archeparchy and the
Peremyshl' and Stanyslaviv eparchies are available for most years
within the period under study.
Of published documents relevant to the Greek-Catholic clergy
between 1900 and 1939, the most important are the various pastoral
letters of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and the bishops of Peremyshi'
and Stanyslaviv. Some of the Metropolitan's pastoral letters are
included in the first volume of his works published in Toronto in
258
1965; this, however, covers only the first eight months of his tenure.
Naturally, certain Papal encyclicals, published in the Acta
Apostolicae Sedis, are of relevance as well. The proceedings of the
Provincial Synod held at L'viv in 1891 were published in 1896; these,
along with the published documents of the L'viv (1905), Peremyshi'
(1898) and Stanyslaviv (1908) eparchial synods, are an essential

The most important archival collections remain on the
territory of the Halych Metropolitanate, which is split between the
USSR and Poland. On the Polish side are th be found the collections of
the Greek-Catholic bishopric and cathedral chapter of PrzemyM, as
well as of the Lemko Apostolic Administration. All three collections
are in the state archive of the Przemyl wojew√≥dztwo at Przemyl.
The major problem in research for this dissertation was the
inaccessibility (until very recently) of archival materials to be found
in the Soviet Union. An excellent bibliography and institutional
directory for Soviet Ukrainian archives is the first book of Patricia
Kennedy Grimsted's Archives and Manuscript Depositories in the
USSR. Ukraine and Moldavia (Princeton, 1988). The Central State
Historical Archive in L'viv contains some 900 collections, some of
which concern the Greek-Catholic clergy. About a third of
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's archive reportedly is contained in
collection 358. It may well contain copies of reports by the
Metropolitan on the condition of his clergy. Until recently, this
collection was available only to a few Soviet scholars and almost
completely inaccessible to foreign scholars. Also useful, presumably,
would be collections 201 (Metropolitan Consistory) and 408
(Metropolitan Ordinariat), which should contain material on
administrative and disciplinary matters concering parish priests.
Collection 451, on the L'viv Theological Academy, would be of obvious
value. According to reports, all the collections in the archive are now
being made available.
Various archives beyond the territory of the Halych
Metropolitanate contain relevant materials. The collections of the
Ministry of Religious Cults and Public Education and of the Ministry
of Internal Affairs at the Archiwum Akt Nowych in Warsaw contain
valuable information on Greek-Catholic priests in the inter-war
period. In London, the Archive of the Polish Institute contains
259
important Polish government collections such as those of the
ambassador to the Hoiy See, Pape. The State Archive at Vienna
contains material on the Greek-Catholic clergy during World War I.
The collection of the Polish Embassy in Washington, D.C. at the
Hoover Institution in Stanford, California includes some material on
Ukrainians in the Republic of Poland, including the Greek-Catholic
Church.
For purposes of this dissertation a survey questionnaire was
sent out to 29 Greek-Catholic priests ordained in the three Galician
eparchies before September 1939. Seven responded. Personal
interviews were also conducted with five priests (two of them tape-
recorded) and one lay activist (tape-recorded) of the pre-war period.
While of very limited statistical value due to the smallness of the
sample, these materials contain many details which tend to confirm
or qualify the conclusions reached on the basis of other sources.
