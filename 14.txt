Catholic clergy as a "caste" -- closed in upon itself, conservative,
jealous of its material interests, bound up with the family, and
worldlly.422

immediately set about to find a wife, usually the daughter of a
priest. 423 Of a number of marriage certificates of candidate priests in
the archive of the Peremyshl' eparchy from 1900-1901, nearly all
indicate that the candidate, whether the son of a priest or a peasant,
married a priest's daughter. 424 In his memoirs, Fr. Tyt
Voinarovs'kyi recounts that having completed his studies in 1878 at
the age of 22, he had two years before he could be ordained, and thus
could travel about the province visiting families with eligible
daughters. He finally married a priest's daughter in 1880, was
ordained at the beginning of the following year, and about a month
later began his duties as assistant priest to his father-in-law. A little
over a year later, after his wife's untimely death, he became assistant
priest to his wife's grandfather at Kolodiivka near Stanyslaviv.425
The custom of intermarriage among priestly families
naturally led to the formation of a caste. In the nineteenth century,
this had constituted the one coherent educated elite of Galician
Ruthenian society, though in the final decades a secular
intelligentsia consisting mostly of professionals (particularly
lawyers) began to assert itself. The clergy were generally regarded as
a higher class. Fr. 0. Prystai recounts that as a secondary school
student in the 1880s he fretted about spending his summer holiday at
the home of a priest because he did not have the requisite manners
and polish. 426 The memoirs of the priest's son and politician Evhen

Khomyshyn, an opponent of a married clergy, used to recount how as rector of
the L'viv seminary in 1902-1904 he had observed that "the final weeks of the
school year at the seminary were very difficult in terms of maintaining student
discipline, because no one was occupied with his studies, no one prepared
properly for examinations or prepared his soul for the priesthood, but for
marriage.., nearly every seminarian had the addresses of all the married
priests who had daughters or of other persons who the seminarians knew had
eligible girls; it was towards this, and not towards their theological studies, that
their minds were turned." Mel'nychuk, Petro. Vladvka Hrvhorii Khomvshvn.

130
Olesnyts'kyi contain a vivid picture of clerical life in the Stryi area in
the 1890s, contrasting it with that of the clergy in Podillia (Podolie) to
the east:
In the villages, the entire strength of the
Ukrainian intelligentsia of the district lay in the
clergy. There was much of it, but it did not
present a very happy sight. True, here there was
no aristocratic clericalism, as in Podillia. The
local clergy generally consisted of good people
who were hospitable and kind-hearted in their
social relations -- and that was all. Social life was
possible and pleasant here. Gatherings and
receptions at priests' homes had a different
character here than in Podillia. There,
everything was puffed up and full of the
consciousness of one's high dignity, sycophantic
towards higher ranks and haughty towards
lower ones. Here there were people who had not
become overly accustomed to haughty thinking,
rather being eager for merriment with a drink
or at cards. The latter flourished especially in the
mountains around Skolie, where famous
specialists appeared, especially in the game of
ferbel'. There were not many interested in
serious debate, and still fewer in serious
systematic work, although -- as it later turned
out -- there were people here who given good
leadership knew how to set to work and
accomplish something good after all. Altogether
it was harder to find serious thought or initiative
among these people than blind obedience, which
they never denied to whoever knew how to win
their confidence.427
Olesnyts'kyi goes on to describe the priest Fr. V. Davydiak, an
energetic and resourceful man, well-educated and well-read, who
like most priests in the area was a Russophile but who unlike most
Russophiles of the time was not an obscurantist, and did not shun
Ukrainian publications. He was also an excellent conversationalist,
distinguished by his pleasant manners, friendliness and wit, who
"knew how to enjoy himself." In fact he was adept at cards, won a
good deal of money, and was known in Skolie as the "king of ferbel'."

Olesnyts'kyi also describes Fr. Lev Shankovs'kyi, parish priest at
Duliby and dean at Stryi, who was sincere, generous, very hospitable
and very merry in company, and at whose house there were always
guests. Though a Russophile at heart, he kept his beliefs to himself
and lived well with both Ukrainians and Poles. Fr. Shankovs'kyi and
Fr. Volodymyr Martynkiv, dean at Skolie, made a jolly pair in society,
and both could joke, sing, and dance; indeed, "it seemed that they
could make a dead man happy." At the same time they were not fit
for public life, and no one expected that they should be.428
The Greek-Catholic priestly "caste" was heavily Old
Ruthenian in cultural orientation, with occasional Russophile
tendencies bordering on the political, as will be discussed in Chapter
Six. What is relevant here is the fact that the demise of the Old
Ruthenians and Russophiles in the first decades of the twentieth
century coincided with the demise of the priestly caste. It would
appear that this group underwent social as well as ideological
extinction.
A rough picture of the demise of the priestly caste can be
drawn by counting the number of family names that appear with a
given frequency in the "schematisms" or registers of priests and
parishes of the three Galician eparchies at different points in the
forty-year span between 1900 and 1939. Although one cannot assume
that several priests with the same surname, particularly a common
one, will be related, it is reasonable to suppose that a surname
appearing five or more times in the schematism of a given eparchy
in most cases will belong to a priestly family. Comparing the
schematisms for the Peremyshi' eparchy for 1896 and 1934, and those
for the L'viv archeparchy for 1897 and 1932-1933, one finds that (1) the
absolute number of surnames appearing five or more times in the
schematism decreased sharply in each case (from 22 to 8 in
Peremyshl', from 24 to 6 in L'viv), (2) the "disappearing" families
were not replaced, "new" families appearing with the same
frequency being very few (only four "new" family names appeared
five or more times in the 1934 Peremyshl' schematism, only three
"new" names in the 1932-1933 L'viv schematism). 429 In the 1936

schematism for the Lemko Apostolic Administration (created in
1934), despite the fact that the Lemko area was known for its large
priestly families, only one surname appears more than three
times 430
An example of a priestly clan that gradually disappeared from
the clergy altogether is the Korosten's'kyi family, two members of
which already appear in the Peremyshi' schematism of 1828. In the
nineteenth century they intermarried with the I1'nyts'kyi and
Levyts'kyi families, both well represented in the Peremyshi'
eparchial clergy. The 1879 schematism lists five members of the
Korostens'kyi family, the 1896 schematism, four. All these were
married or widowed. Three appear in the 1902 schematism, but none
in 1928 or 1929. The last family members in the priesthood appear to
have been two brothers (both members of the Kachkovs'ky Society and
therefore presumably Old Ruthenians) who died in 1921 and 1926.
What happened to the sons of such families? Many entered
other professions; some entered politics. Such prominent Galician
Ukrainian politicians as Oleksander Barvins'kyi (1847-1927), Evhen
Olesnyts'kyi (1860-1917), Kost' Levyts'kyi (1859-1941) and the Western
Ukrainian dictator Evhen Petrushevych (1863-1940) came from
clerical families. 432 The same is true of prominent individuals born
somewhat later, such as the composer Filiaret Kolessa (1871-1947),
the politician Dmytro Paliiv (1896-1944), and the nationalist leaders
Stepan Bandera (1909-1959) and Iaroslav Stets'ko (1912-1986). The

Petrushevych family included some ten priests in the nineteenth
century, not counting a few sons-in-law who were also priests. But it
appears that in the twentieth century most of their descendants
became lawyers or teachers. 434 Indeed, Fr. Sokhots'kyi claims that
most of the "professors" who constituted the first generation of
secular Galician Ukrainian intelligentsia and of the "lawyers" who
followed them and led Ukrainian politics in the twentieth century
were Sons of Greek-Catholic priests. 435 It has been estimated that
although in the inter-war period, the majority of the Ukrainian
intelligentsia was of peasant origin, during the first decade of this
period around twenty per cent were of priestly origin.436
Mel'nychuk asserts that married priests generally had only
one or two children, and only rarely three or four; few of these
entered the clergy, and sons often became Radicals or
Communists. 437 In 1916, Nyva complained that many priests' Sons
had become enemies of the Church and especially of the clergy, and
blamed this on their fathers' failure to teach them that the Church
was closely tied to the people. The sons regarded their fathers'
priestly work as motivated simply by pecuniary gain, and concluded
that the clergy were the enemies of the common folk. 438 A Polish
writer concerned with Russian Orthodox influence in the Greek-
Catholic Church pointed out in 1912 that priestly families could be a
source of destructive ideas, noting that free love was first preached in
Galicia by a priest's daughter, and that a priest's son headed the
Radical movement.439

The first reference is presumably to the feminist and socialist Nataliia
Kobryns'ka (1851 or 1855-1920), daughter of the parish priest Fr. Ivan
Ozarkevych (1826-1903), who herself was married to a parish priest (Fr. Teofll
Kobryns'kyi, d. 1882). See Bohachevsky-Chomiak, Martha, "Natalia
Kobryns'ka: Formulator of Feminism,' in Markovits, Andrei S. & Sysyn,
Frank E., eds. Nationbuilding and the Politics of Nationalism: Essa y s on
Austrian Galicia. Cambridge, Mass., 1982, 196-219, esp. 197, 199. The priest's son
was probably Iuliian Bachyns'kyi, born 1870, son of the Lviv canon, vicar-
134
Whether or not Oedipal rebellion was an important
phenomenon in Galician clerical families, it is significant that sons
began to enter other professions. As will be seen in Chapter Five, the
Old Ruthenian convictions and the social conservatism of the clergy,
as well as their reputed aloofness from the common people, may well
have played a role in deterring priests' Sons from following in their
fathers' footsteps. Economic ruin and political discreditation of Old
Ruthenians and Russophiles during and after the World War were
probably more important factors. 440 In the meantime, the economic
hardship and employment discrimination suffered by the peasantry
and lower middle class in particular brought fresh blood into the
clergy.
2. Celibacy
One phenomenon to which the fall of the priestly dynasties
cannot be attributed is the introduction of compulsory priestly
celibacy, discussed in Chapter Two. For compulsory celibacy to
diminish the number of priestly families would require at least 25
years, since the absence of priests' sons from the clergy could only be
assumed after the lapse of the number of years in which a candidate
would otherwise marry and have a child and in which his son would
complete his studies and be ordained. Thus, even the introduction of
partial celibacy in the L'viv seminary in 1918 could not have affected
the existence of priestly families in the L'viv archeparchy until 1943;
the introduction of compulsory celibacy in Stanyslaviv in 1920 could
not have registered its effects until 1945, and that in Peremyshl' in
1925 would only have made itself felt in 1950. Furthermore, the
priestly family as a horizontal unit -- that is, in the fraternal rather
general and seminary rector Fr. Oleksander Bachyns'kyi (1844-1933). The
younger Bachyns'kyi, author of Ukraina Irredenta (1896), moved to the
Ukrainian SSR in 1929 and was arrested there in 1934.
Evhen Olesnyts'kyi says in his memoirs that the Shankovs'kyi family
"were reduced to beggars" by the war, when the villages of Duliby and
Hrabovets' were burnt to the ground in the military operations of 1914 and 1915.
The church, the rectory, all the parish buildings and the school at Duliby were
destroyed. Fr. Petro Shankovskyi, the only son of the Old Ruthenian Fr. Lev
Shankovs'kyi and his successor as dean of the Stryi deanery, had abandoned
Russophilism and become an active Ukrainian. He served both Duliby, where he
lived, and Hrabovets'. Because of a false denunciation, Fr. Petro Shankovs'kyi
was arrested by the Austrian military tribunal in Stryi and spent three weeks in
jail. Olesnyts'kyi, Evhen. SDohadv z moho zhyttia. L'viv, 1935, Part II, 20.

than the filial relationship -- naturally existed as long as the last
generation of priests' Sons survived.
However, the imposition of compulsory priestly celibacy in two
eparchies and the encouragement of celibacy in the third did affect
the social complexion amd status of the Greek-Catholic parish clergy
in other ways. Most obviously, the number of married priests
declined. In 1879, 604 of the 770 secular priests of the Peremyshi'
eparchy were married and 131 widowed, with only 35 celibates.441
Twenty-three years later the picture had not changed substantially:
there were 654 married priests and 200 widowers out of 897 priests in
1902, with only 43 celibates. 442 In the Stanyslaviv eparchy in 1897,425
of the 534 parish priests were married and 101 were widowers, with
only eight celibate priests. 443 Between 1914 and 1938, however, the
picture changed dramatically in all three eparchies. In the L'viv
archdiocese, the number of celibate priests jumped from 38 to 154
(14.67% of the eparchial clergy in 1938); in Peremyshi', from 13 to 206
(25.3% of the eparchial clergy in 1938); in Stanyslaviv, from 61 to 245
(46.7%). Overall, the number of celibate priests in the Galician
province increased by a factor of nearly six (from 112 in 1914 to 605 in
1938), from 9.55% of the clergy to 25.25%. By 1938, married priests
numbered 1,541 or 64% of the clergy, and widowers 244 or 10.75%.
What one cannot quantify is the change in the motivations of
men entering the priesthood in this period. In the Stanyslaviv and
Peremyshl' eparchies, a vocation to the priesthood meant a
commitment to celibacy. This was a radical break with the tradition
of the priestly caste -- and with the expectation of a comfortable
family life. It required a willingness to sacrifice the prospect of
continuing the kind of life one had grown up with, and to enter an
unfamiliar state of being which moreover would resemble that of the
traditional competitors, the Polish clergy. In any case, according to
Cyrille Korolevskij it was only a small minority of Greek-Catholic
priests that favoured celibacy, and only some of these wished it to be

compulsory; the overwhelming majority opposed When on 31
August 1918 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi announced in his official
bulletin that half the places in the L'viv seminary would be reserved
for those committed to celibacy, the first deputation to attempt to
persuade him to withdraw the order was composed of priests.446
According to the lay protest to Rome against the imposition of
priestly celibacy in the Peremyshl' eparchy, the clergy passed
various resolutions against this action at their deanery meetings,
and in both the Peremyshl' and the Stanyslaviv eparchy celibates as
well as married and widowed priests appealed to Church authorities
against their bishops' actions in this regard.447
The debate over compulsory priestly celibacy was at least
formally a matter of canon law, 448 and also figured in the
controversy between "Byzantinists" and "Westernisers" (see Chapter
Seven, Section 1). Here it is relevant to note the arguments of a socio-
economic nature, which loomed large in the public discussion. In
replying to the prominent lay representatives Oleksander
Barvins'kyi (a priest's son) and Iuliian Romanchuk (a son of a
priest's daughter), who after the failure of a larger delegation to
dissuade him from his decision on celibacy visited him on 16
September 1918, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi pointed out that under
current conditions, there were many positions in which a married
priest could not survive. For example, there were catechetical posts
not yielding sufficient income to support a family, some 200 parishes
so ravaged during the war that the rectory could not possibly house a
family, and many posts for an assistant priest who would not even
have his own kitchen and must live in a small room in the parish
priest's home, not to mention missionary positions for which a
married priest could not even apply. The metropolitan also rejected
the argument -- frequently advanced by the laity -- that priestly
celibacy would cut off the socio-biological sources of the lay
Korolevskij 49-50. Korolevskij refers to Metropolitan Sheptytskyi's 1928
memorandum to Pope Pius XI, in which he explains some of the difficulties in
the introduction of celibacy among the Galician Ukrainians, such as the lack of
a tradition of celibate clergy and the antipathy for the one example of clerical
celibacy with which they were familiar: the Polish priest.

intelligentsia, pointing out that celibate priests would be better able to
provide education for peasant sons and daughters. Finally, he
asserted that the great majority of married priests actually favoured
the increase in numbers of celibates.449
The imposition of compulsory celibacy in the Peremyshi'
eparchy in 1925 does seem to have caused a drop in ordinations --
from 44 in 1925 and 43 in the following year (third and fourth year
students presumably would have been reluctant to drop out at that
stage) to ten in 1927, six in 1928, 17 in 1929 and 18 in 1930. Although
the number of ordinations reached 34 in 1938, it did not regain the
level of 1925.° This made it all the more difficult to fill the many
vacancies in the Peremyshi' eparchy.45'
Proponents and opponents of priestly celibacy disputed the
comparative zeal with which married and unmarried priests
carried on pastoral work. According to some accounts, married
priests were more dedicated to working with their parishioners than
celibates, who tended instead to continue their education.452
However, Bishop Khomyshyn argued that a celibate priest was more
