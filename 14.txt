militantly anti-clerical socialist force.62Â°
Polish populism developed along similar lines in Galicia. The
"populist" or peasant movement led by Fr. Stojatowski in fact
exhibited anti-clerical tendencies as well as elements of socialism,
nationalism, and anti-Semitism. It was, however, not as socially
radical as its counterpart in the Russian partition, nor closely
comparable to nineteenth-century Russian populism. Polish
populism in Galicia generally represented the interests of landed
peasants. In inter-war Poland the "Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe"
would become an influential if ideologically amorphous party which
contributed men like Wincenty Witos and Stanislaw Mikolajczyk.621
In 1899, a number of Ruthenian right Radicals and populists
formed the National Democratic Party which in its various
subsequent incarnations became the dominant party in Ruthenian
and Ukrainian Galician politics for the next forty years. However,
the Radicals remained a force, with some eventually joining the
Communists and others forming the Ukrainian Socialist Radical
Party. The Social Democratic and Social Christian parties exerted
less influence. All of these, however, opposed the novokursnvkv, both

for their social conservatism and for their rejection of the Ukrainian
orientation.
Despite Polish support, the Russophiles began to lose their
political influence as suffrage was extended in Austria. The 1907
reform of the electoral system in Parliament enabled the populists to
gain at the expense of the Russophiles. After the assassination of
Viceroy Potocki by a Ukrainophile student in April 1908, his
successor Michal Bobrzyfiski discontinued the policy of supporting
the Russophiles, pursuing a more even-handed policy which allowed
the populists to assert themselves. In particular, he took steps which
culminated, with Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's cooperation, in the
electoral reform finally enacted under the next viceroy, Witold
Korytowski, in January 1914.622
It has been asserted that as Bishop of Stanyslaviv in 1899-1900,
Sheptyts'kyi favoured the Russophiles. 623 It appears that as
Metropolitan, he maintained a neutral stance. The Russophiles did
control the higher ecclesiastical posts in Galicia. The populists, on
the other hand, were hostile to Sheptyts'kyi despite his actions on
behalf of the Ruthenian cause. Furthermore, populism was still
associated with anti-clericalism, though by this time there were
many populist priests as well. The Metropolitan's condemnation of
the 1908 assassination of the Viceroy Potocki was resented by many
lay populists. 624 His order of 27 August 1908 forbidding priests to
interfere in each other's parishes was interpreted as being directed
against populist priests conducting activity in the parishes of their
Russophile neighbours. Nevertheless, a rapprochement between
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and the populists took place in the years
preceding the first world war.
At the same time, Orthodox agitation evidently prompted the
Metropolitan to warn against the dangers of schism in a pastoral
letter of 31 March 1910. 625 Bishop Khomyshyn did likewise in 1911.626

In early 1912, the Peremyshi' episcopal ordinariat requested all
deans to hold special meetings at which, among other things, the
Metropolitan's 1910 letter would be read, and parish priests would
report on any schismatic agitation in their parishes. 627 In July, 1912
the Metropolitan Ordinariat in L'viv ordered deans and parish
priests to try to prevent pilgrimages across the Russian border to
Pochaiv and to report any that were being planned; it also asked the
clergy to use the political authorities to weed out schismatic
agitators. The priests were reminded that they must teach the
faithful the difference between Catholicism and schism, and deans
were urged to arrange for missions in their deaneries. The matter of
schism was to be given foremost attention at deanery meetings.628
Russophilism thus came to be identified with schism, and
most of the Greek-Catholic clergy began to follow Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi's lead in abandoning it. Gradually, they adopted a
populist and then an outright nationalist orientation. 629 At the same
time, the need to preserve the Eastern tradition and to stave off
polonisation and latinisation -- a need which lay at the heart of the
Russophile movement -- came to be satisfied under Sheptyts'kyi's
guidance in a way that avoided absorption into Russian Orthodoxy.
This was the way of Church Union, which will be discussed below.630
In September 1914 the Russian army arrived in Galicia. The
rapidly retreating Austrians rounded up and hanged suspected
Russophiles, including priests. Several hundred Greek-Catholic
priests were deported to detention camps in Thalerhof,
those who oppose frequent communion and devotions to the Sacred Heart. It also
asserts that the Catholic faith, unlike that of the schismatics, is truly "Orthodox,"
and that the Union of 1596 was a voluntary reunion of the Ruthenians with the
One Church of Rome, which was the Church of St. Vladimir and various other
Eastern saints.

due to denunciations by Poles. 632 Russophiles allege that it was the

The Russian occupation of Galicia lasted several months
from the autumn of 1914 to the spring of 1915; Russian forces held
parts of Galicia into 1916, and made further gains as a result of the
Brusilov offensive in that year. During this time, the civil
administration treated the Ruthenian population fairly leniently.
However, Archbishop Evlogii of Voihynia attempted to carry through
a mass conversion of the Greek-Catholics to the Orthodox Church,
with the cooperation of the Russophiles. He sent Orthodox clergy to
take over parishes abandoned by Greek-Catholic priests who had fled
before the Russians or been arrested by the Austrians. In fact, the
Russian civil authorities were annoyed by his measures and sought
to restrain him. 634 In the event, a number of priests (perhaps 50) did

opposed Evlogii's "tactless agitation" for Orthodoxy. Dmytro Doroshenko, who
represented the Russian government in Galicia, relates that Bobrinskii
complained in a report that Evlogii had ignored his orders, appointing priests to
parishes where only a few people had requested one. By April 1915 Evlogii had
created 113 Orthodox parishes in Galicia, and during the next two months the
192
convert, along with all or part of various villages, particularly in the
border region of eastern Galicia. When the Russians retreated, a
number of priests and faithful who had converted to Orthodoxy fled
with them, fearing Austrian reprisals. 635 For others, however, the
Russian occupation brought disillusionment. The reality of the often
poorly educated Russian clergy, insensitive to Ruthenian traditions
and sensibilities, and speaking a language that sounded more
foreign than it appeared on paper, dispelled the Russophile
dream.636
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi himself was arrested by the Russian
authorities in September 1914 and deported to Russia, to be released
in 1917.637 By the time of his return to L'viv in 1918 he was hailed by
Galician Ukrainians as a national hero. On 21 February of that year,
he and Bishops Khomyshyn and Kotsylovs'kyi issued a joint pastoral
letter criticising the Russophile ideology and urging their priests to
number nearly doubled. After the Russian offensive of 1916, however, Evlogii
was not allowed to continue his campaign for the conversion of Galicia.

adopt the Ukrainian orientation of their faithful. 638 At the same
time, the downfall of Tsarist Russia rendered political Russophilism
virtually irrelevant; after the Bolshevik take-over, it became pointless,
at least for the clergy. 639 It has also been argued that Russophilism
was a moribund philosophy in that it could not absorb the
"revolutionaries" of the younger generation, something which vital
movements are always able to do. 64 Â° Furthermore, the end of Tsarist
funding of the Russophile movement removed one of its chief
supports. The fact that in Russian Ukraine, Tsarism had been
supplanted in 1917 by a Ukrainian People's Republic which declared
independence in January 1918 aroused public enthusiasm in Galicia
and vindicated the populist cause. A Western Ukrainian People's
Republic was formed in October 1918, followed by struggle with
Poland over Galicia. All this tended to eclipse Russophile
aspirations. Gradually, Old Ruthenian priests began to go over to the
Ukrainian camp.
While the Old Ruthenians were on the wane in most of Galicia
(albeit retaining the Stauropegial Institute and publishing house
and the People's Home in L'viv), in the Lemko region, the western
section of the Peremyshi' eparchy, the Old Ruthenian clergy and its
Russophile ideology persisted. Perhaps in reaction to Latin-rite and
Polish pressures, as well as to the imposition of compulsory priestly
celibacy in 1925, there was a wave of Orthodox schism in the late
1920s. Some 20 parishes joined the Orthodox Church. 641 This was
reinforced by Lemko separatist tendencies and a reaction against the

hectoring of Ukrainian nationalists -- including priests -- from
Eastern Galicia. 642 The Orthodox movement was sufficiently
alarming to the Catholic Church to warrant creation of a special
Apostolic Administration in 1934.643
The Lemko Apostolic Administration appears to have been the
product of the confluence of interests of the Roman Catholic Church
and the Polish government. The government sought to prevent
Ukrainian nationalist influences from entering this area; it was
known that Bishop Kotyslovs'kyi had been sending Ukrainian
nationalist priests to the Lemko region. 644 The Roman Catholic
Church, for its part, saw the need for direct supervision where there
was a danger of mass apostasy. Both the political isolation of the
Lemko region and religious control from Rome would be served by
the creation of the new administrative entity. Of course, the Holy See
and the Polish government also had conflicting aims: the former
wished to preserve Greek Catholicism in the area, while the latter
preferred the advancement of Orthodoxy. Whether the Lemko
Apostolic Administration was a success from either point of view is
difficult to determine, as it had only five years before the German
occupation of these lands irrevocably changed the situation.

annoyed their Lemko parishioners. It was argued, however, that "it was

Catholic and dispel his sympathies for Orthodoxy." I.H. "Dvadtsiat lit na

(However, the tendency to join the Orthodox Church continues to this
day as a limitation on Latin-rite pressure upon Greek-Catholics in
this region, while the tradition of government support for the
Orthodox Church as a counter-weight to Catholicism of either rite
continues, if anything, more strongly than before.)
Thus, the cultural Russophilism of the Old Ruthenian clergy
found both its apogee and its demise in its ultimate political and
religious consequences. Identification with Imperial Russia died in
the first world war. Apostasy and flight to Russia obviously meant
leaving the Greek-Catholic priesthood. A number of Old Ruthenian
priests died in Austrian internment camps. The passing of
ideological Russophilism coincided with the fall of the priestly
dynasties and the departure of their scions from the priesthood. A
harmless cultural Old Ruthenianism lingered among the elder
Galician clergy. Only in the Lemko region did religious
Russophilism remain strong. While Orthodox conversions occurred
among the Lemko laity, the Russophile clergy in that region
remained staunchly Greek-Catholic. In the meantime, the majority
of the Greek-Catholic priests in Galicia adopted the Ukrainian
national orientation.
2. From Ruthenian Populists to Ukrainian Nationalists
As has been seen above, much of the populist movement, and
particularly its Radical current, was anti-clerical, and relations
between Church and intelligentsia were often hostile. Even the
growing number of populist priests could not accept the tenets of the
laymen with whom they worked in enlightening the village. Yet by
1939, when Ruthenian populists had become Ukrainian nationalists,
the Greek-Catholic clergy were almost entirely in the Ukrainian
national camp. How did this happen?
The answer lies in changes that occurred among both the
clergy and the populist movement, as well as in external political
events. As Russophilism of the Old Ruthenian variety waned and
that of the religious (Orthodox) and political (pro-Russian) type
perished in the world war, the Greek-Catholic clergy sought a new
national and political identity. Radicalism seemed at first to prevent
the kind of cooperation between clerical and lay populist
intelligentsia in "organic work" among the people that had occurred
196
in the 1870s and 1880 g . The gulf between priests and populists had
grown great. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and Bishops Chekhovych and
Khomyshyn criticised Radicalism in a pastoral letter of 1907 on the
parliamentary elections. 645 The pages of the clerical journal Nyva,
founded in 1904 and supported by Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, are full
of attacks on Radicalism. 646 After the assassination of the Viceroy
Potocki Metropolitan Sheptytskyi condemned the act in a sermon;
and in a joint pastoral letter addressed to the faithful, the Galician
bishops warned of the dangers of politics without God, declaring that
a crime in the name of patriotism was particularly evil because
people might be tempted to praise jt.647 Populist, if not popular,
opinion roundly criticised the Metropolitan for his condemnation.
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi ignored the hostility of the populists
and supported various national causes. In 1901 he had implicitly
approved of the Ruthenian student strike and had helped the
students pursue their studies abroad. In 1910 he spoke out in the
House of Lords in Vienna in support of a Ukrainian university. In
1913-1914 he was instrumental in the electoral reform that would
have given the Ruthenians political power commensurate with their
numbers. He had blessed the blue and yellow colours of the "Sich
Sharpshooters," a Ukrainian formation in the Austrian army, in
1914. A prisoner of Tsarist Russia, he returned in 1917 to speak out in
the following year against clerical Russophilism and in support of
the Ukrainian orientation. He supported the peace of Brest-Litovsk,
in which the Central Powers recognised the Ukrainian People's
Republic, in Parliament on 28 February 1918. In the succeeding
years, he travelled extensively to gain support for the Ukrainian
state. Upon returning to Poland in 1923 he was interned in Poznaxi by
the government authorities until he agreed to issue a pastoral letter
calling for obedience to the Polish authorities in Galicia.648

648 Different versions of the circumstances and reasons for the arrest have
been advanced. This version is given by Andrzej ZiÃ§ba, citing Papierzyi{ska-
Turek, who had access to the minutes of sessions of the Political Committee of
197
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi was loyal to the Western Ukrainian
dictator Evhen Petrushevych. 649 For the Greek-Catholic clergy,
Sheptyts'kyi legitimised first the Ruthenian populist, and then the
Ukrainian nationalist cause.
The Greek-Catholic priest, however, was no stranger to
politics. 650 Since the mid-nineteenth century various members of the
clergy had held seats in the Galician diet and the parliament in
Vienna, some for long spans of years. Many of these had been Old
Ruthenians.65'
True, with the gradual secularisation of Ruthenian Galician
politics, clerical representation in the elected bodies was diminished.
Nevertheless, with the establishment of the Western Ukrainian
Popular Republic in October 1918, many Greek-Catholic priests were
given the opportunity to participate directly in the experience of
nation-building. Some held important political posts or worked in the
local administration. 652 Others served as chaplains in the Ukrainian
Galician Army in the campaigns against the Poles in 19181919.653

650 Under the 1917 Code of Canon Law, a priest could not hold public office
without permission from the Holy See, nor act as an elected deputy without
permission of the Holy See or (depending on circumstances) of his bishop-
ordinary. Codex luris Canonici (1917), in Acta ADostolicae Sedis vol. IX pars II,
Liber Secundus, Titulus III, Canon 139 secs. 2, 4. Although the Code of Canon
Law may be referred to as a source of law by the Eastern Church, it is binding on
the Latin Church alone, and obligates the Eastern Church only in those matters
which by their nature concern that Church as well. Id. Canon 1.

campaigns. 654 Those who were stationed in eastern Ukraine had an
opportunity to acquaint themselves with the people with which
Ruthenian populists had identified since 1848. The encounter with
an awakening Ukraine, distinct from the Russia adulated by the Old
Ruthenians, fortified the younger clerics' notion of a united
Ukrainian state. 655 In 1919-1921, many priests were arrested or
interned as the Polish authorities took control of Galicia. 656 These
experiences must have played an important part in the formation of
the clergy's political outlook.
Political activism was by no means unique to the Greek-
Catholic clergy. The activist Polish priest was a familiar figure in
nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Poland, particularly in the
Prussian partition. 657 In Galicia, Fr. JÃ³zef Panas (1887-1940,
ordained 1911), later known as a political figure, took part as a
military chaplain in the battles for Peremyshi' and L'viv. 658 Abroad,
too, members of the clergy were prominent in politics; in 1922 Fr.
Ignaz Seipel became Chancellor of Austria.
The events of the world war and the Ukrainian war of
liberation prompted the Greek-Catholic priest to define his political
position. As Ruthenian populism developed into Ukrainian
nationalism, it became a more palatable alternative to Russophilism.
At the same time Radicalism, like Russophilism, was to some extent
a casualty of wartime opportunities. Russia was taken over by a left-
wing socialist party. The Western Ukrainian Popular Republic found

the Stanyslaviv eparchy. He also provides a list of 44 monastic priests, six
seminarians and 43 nuns. He notes, however, that his list of arrested priests is
not complete. Lebedovych, Ivan. Polevi dukhovnyky 237-242. Elsewhere he states
that about a thousand Greek-Catholic priests were arrested by the Polish
authorities. Lebedovych, Ivan. Z martvrolohii dukhovenstva Zakhidnoi Ukrainv.

itself pitted against Bolsheviks as well as Poles (although a portion of
the Ukrainian Galician Army eventually did join the Red Army after
being driven out of Galicia by Hailer's troops). After the collapse of
Petliura's and Pilsudski's joint eastern offensive, for two and a half
months in the summer of 1920, sixteen districts around Ternopil'
constituted a Galician Soviet Socialist Republic. On 1 August 1920,
the Galician Revolutionary Committee (Halrevkom) declared
separation of Church from state and school. 659 Suddenly, radical left
socialism was a concrete and not altogether pleasant reality.
Although in the 1920s, Ukrainianisation in the Ukrainian SSR made
Bolshevism attractive to some Galician Ukrainians, the liquidation
of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine in 1928 and the
destruction of independent Ukrainian life by Stalin's regime after
1929 tended to discredit left-wing socialism in the eyes of many. As
the Galician Ukrainian political spectrum moved to the right
towards the end of the 1920s, it became easier for the traditionally
conservative Greek-Catholic clergy to find its place in it. In 1925 the
Labour Party regrouped with moderate populists as the Ukrainian
National Democratic Union (UNDO). Around 1928, "Prosvita"
purged its leftist elements. Having long sympathised with
Ruthenian and Ukrainian populism, the clergy could again join
hands with the populists with a clear conscience. As before the war,
a number of priests were politically active. It has even been asserted
that it was the influence of the priests that assured UNDO's
dominance in Ukrainian Galician politics.660
Of course, not all Greek-Catholic priests supported UNDO. The
surviving Old Ruthenians continued to oppose the "Ukrainians" and
maintained total loyalty to Poland. Fr. Mykola fl'kiv of the Ukrainian

period. Fr. Iuliian Tatomyr (1883-1946, ordained 1908) was elected to the Senate
on the UNDO slate in 1928. An assistant priest and catechist in Sambir, he had
worked in "Prosvita" and other social organisations. In 1918 he had organised
the peasantry and "took Sambir from the Poles. Later he served in various
parishes, continuing his social and cultural work. He was imprisoned several
times. Utrysko, Myron, ed. Boikivshchvna. Naukove Tovarystvo im.

Peasant Party announced a normalisation with the Polish
government in 1923.661 Other priests supported a conservative
platform, some following the ideas of Viacheslav Lypyns'kyi
(Wadaw Lipiiski). 662 However, the Galician bishops set an example
in supporting the boycott of the 1922 Polish elections, at a time when
the Polish occupation of Galicia had not been ratified by the League
of Nations, and by protesting against the Council of Ambassadors'
decision of 14 March 1923 awarding Eastern Galicia to Poland.663
The rank and file clergy often defied or circumvented the
requirement, specified in the 1925 Concordat, of reciting a liturgical
prayer for the prosperity of the Republic of Poland and of its
President each Sunday and on the Third of May.664

662     Fr. V. Babyn complained in "Nova Zoria" in 1927 that "there is hardly
another nation that so easily falls prey to leftist attitudes" as the Ukrainian, and
that the intelligentsia had lost the values of the village, such as religiosity. The
further one went to the left, the more he was considered a patriot. Mentioning
Lypyns'kyi, Fr. Babyn called for the organisation of conservative forces on a
Christian ethical basis. 'Nova Zoria" no. 28 (79), 17 July 1927. On Lypyns'kyi's
thought, see the special issue on "The Political and Social Ideas of Vjaceslav

requisite prayer, in Latin, was agreed upon by a conference of bishops in
Warsaw in May of 1925. Appropriate decrees were issued by Bishop Khomyshyn
of Stanyslaviv on 4 March 1926 and by Archbishop-Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi of
L'viv on 15 March 1926. In April 1926, the L'viv district starosta provided the
county authorities with a list of 37 parishes in which Greek-Catholic priests
failed to fully and properly recite the prayer; one priest, according to a
confidential report, said a prayer for Ukraine instead. In June 1926 the L'viv
governor reported to the Ministry of Religious Cults that the majority of the
Ruthenian clergy in Lviv county were not reciting the required prayer. Some
did recite it, but others claimed that they had not received instructions from their
