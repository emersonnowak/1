The necessity of finding an ecclesiastical cultural orientation
was accompanied by the challenge of Ukrainian secular culture.
From its beginnings to the end of the eighteenth century, Ukrainian
high culture had been almost exclusively religious. By 1900, in
Galicia as well as in the Russian Ukraine, a secular Ukrainian high
culture had developed. Influenced by western European currents and
responding to local social conditions, this culture, at least in its
literary forms, contained anti-clerical elements. The Ukrainian
national poet, Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861), had inveighed against
Uniatism as a tool of historical Polish imperialism. The foremost
Galician Ukrainian literary figure, Ivan Franko (1856-1916), had
criticised the socio-economic role of the Greek-Catholic clergy.
Ukrainian culture not only had become secularised, but seemed, at
least in part, to be turning against the Church. If the clergy had been
the leaders of the Ruthenian cultural revival in the mid-nineteenth
century, now they found themselves among its targets.
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi saw the problem, which he
addressed in his 1901 pastoral letter to the Ruthenian intelligentsia.
Rather than seeking to dictate to them, he aimed for a harmonious
coexistence between the Church and the secular intelligentsia. 739 At
first this was difficult, given the anti-clerical attitude of much of the
latter. It appears that the Metropolitan sought to reconcile Ivan
Franko and his fellow writer Vasyl' Stefanyk with the Church. 740 He
provided funding for painters like Oleksa Novakivs'kyi and
commissioned church art in its various forms. The journal Dzvony,
which enjoyed his financial support, provided a forum for Catholic
writers and critics like the talented Lemko poet Bohdan Ihor
Antonych (1909-1937). Sheptyts'kyi also founded a Ukrainian national
museum in 1905 which, serving after its opening in 1913 as a
showplace for Ukrainian ecclesiastical art and antiquities, helped to
create a sense of a millennial tradition of Ukrainian spiritual

written in Vienna and dated 27 January 1901. The Metropolitan had also
addressed the intelligentsia in his first pastoral letter as Bishop of Stanyslaviv
in 1899, and mentioned the problem of the intelligentsia in his pastoral letter to
the Stanyslaviv clergy of that same day. Tvorv 14-16, 26-27.

culture. As anti-clerical currents died down in the 1920s and 1930s,
the idea of a modern Ukrainian Christian culture began to seem
feasible.
Nevertheless, Ukrainian culture, like that of most modern
nations, had reached a secular stage. Inevitably, some of it was at
odds with Church teachings and tastes. Unlike Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi, who had grown up in a cosmopolitan milieu, Bishop
Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv was quick to characterise literature as
anti-religious or immoral. While acknowledging their talents, he
criticised both Taras Shevchenko and Ivan Franko. 74 ' The bishop
was not alone in his criticism of the latter. In 1913, in response to
widespread celebrations in honour of Franko, Nykolai Sadovs'kyi
(possibly a Basilian monk) wrote a brochure criticising a priest who
had publicly supported the celebrations in an article in the L'viv daily
"Dilo." Pointing out that Franko (then still alive) was an enemy of
Christ, Sadovs'kyi declared that he should recognise that his artistic
talent was a gift from God, and should use it to serve him. 742 At a
session of the Peremyshl' cathedral chapter on 27 May 1919, Bishop
Kotsylovs'kyi asked his canons how he should respond to the request
of the local intelligentsia for a service in memory of the poet, who had
died three years before. Several of the canons recommended asking
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's opinion. However, the young Rev. Canon
Konstantyn Bohachevs'kyi (future Metropolitan of Philadelphia) felt
that in view of Franko's scandalous writings and the circumstances
of his death, no service could be held. His opinion prevailed.743
In 1927 "Nova Zoria," which represented Bishop Khomyshyn's
point of view, reprinted part of a pseudonymous article arguing that
although Ivan Franko had begun to return to the faith and the
Church late in life and on visits to his native village of Nahuievychi
would even read the epistle during liturgy, he had been an atheist in
his younger years, and it was this Franko -- "Saul, not Paul" -- that
was the object of the cult then current amongst the intelligentsia.744

intelligentsia's reverence for both Shevchenko and Franko, whose
works could be found in priests' private libraries.745
While seeking to harmonise secular culture with the
teachings of the Church, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and his followers
naturally sought to revive Ukrainian religious culture. This involved
the support, for example, of icon-painters and choirs. 746 It also
required a vision of the relationship between Ukrainian religious (not
just ecclesiastical) culture and both the East and the West. Such a
vision was formed among the clergy through various contacts with
western and eastern culture. In December 1913 Osyp Ostashevs'kyi
wrote of the L'viv seminarians' encounter with the West during the
secession of 190 1-1902:
The relations of the secessionist seminarians
with seminarians of other peoples, and with
laymen of sincerely Catholic convictions, above
all in Vienna, had a beneficial effect on the
change of our seminarians' world view. They
saw how our intelligentsia in general received
western civilisation, but only that part of it that
was far from the principles of the teachings of
Christ; they were aware that such culture
brings destruction and not good to our society. In
the midst of such conditions our young
seminarians understood that above all they
must receive Catholic religious ideas from the
West and colour the national and social aspect of
our national life with them, and thus react
against the dark forces of advancing
faithlessness.747
Thus, the Greek-Catholic clergy had begun to discover western
European culture for itself. No longer dependent on the secular
intelligentsia's narrow vision of this culture, which selected those
aspects congenial to its prejudices and concerns, the clergy could
develop its own view of western civilisation. It could thus seek out
Christian elements and adapt them to its own cultural vision. As
early as 1901, rulijan Dzerovych, who was to become a highly
influential priest, could confidently assert that "cool critical

intelligence, deeper learning lead to Christ; only the superficial leads
away from him" and point to the revival of Christian ideas in great
Western nations like England, France and the United States. To
Dzerovych, only "the unprogressive cling to atheism." 748 This
implied a critique of current Western European as well as Ukrainian
secular culture -- a critique that could be carried on by a Christian
secular intelligentsia as well as by the clergy. Thus, as seen in the
pages of Dzvony and reflected in the works of creative artists close to
the Church, a Ukrainian secular culture of Christian inspiration
could arise.
A Ukrainian Christian culture, whether sacred or secular,
would inevitably reflect the orientation of the Church at least in some
degree. As seen above, this Church remained divided on the question
of East or West. The cultural confusion inherent in "Uniatism" was
mirrored in the aesthetics of church art. The pseudonymous Rev.
S.M. of B. remarked in 1916 that some new Greek-Catholic churches
were "monstrosities without taste, style or beauty." Well-intentioned
but misguided parish priests were importing church art from
Bavaria or the Tyrol. This repelled the faithful, and in any case did
not inspire piety or love. If the priests had been better educated, he
continued, they would know their own Church and would not be
replacing beautiful traditional songs with all sorts of German and
Italian themes, which were often secular and would "turn our
churches into concert halls." If these priests were better acquainted
with their own history and traditions, they would not need to pack
their sermons with examples from German or Italian life.7
To what extent did the Galician parish priest take an interest
in the building of a Ukrainian Christian culture and in the guiding
of secular culture in accord with Christian principles? Presumably,
few had the leisure to indulge in such interests. Overwhelmingly
rural, they had little access to the "high" culture of the city. Yet those
that could afford subscriptions to journals like Dzvony could
acquaint themselves with the writings of Ukrainian writers such as
Antonych or foreign ones like Mauriac. Even in the poor parishes of
the Lemko region, priests' private libraries included works of such
contemporary writers as Bohdan Lepkyi and Ulas Samchuk (as well

232
as foreign classics like Baizac, Jules Verne, Dostoevsky, Gogol,
Toisthy, Mickiewicz, Brontéç Dickens, and Jack London).750
There were also a few priests who entertained great ambitions
to develop a Ukrainian religious culture on a par with those of other
European nations. Thus, Fr. I. Chekhovych wished th create a shrine
at Chaikovychi near Sambir that would gain international renown as
a "Ukrainian Lourdes." Fr. Chekhovych also promoted the fame of
the stigmatic Evstakhiia Bokhniak, 75 ' while Fr. Petro Dzedzyk
supported (though with some reservations) the claims of "the first
Ukrainian stigmatic," Nastya Voloshyn of Mlyny in the Iavoriv
dlistrict. 752 These initiatives, while naive and at times comical, can all
be understood as part of a general effort to create a national Catholic
culture modelled on those of the great Catholic nations of Europe.
Thus, at least some members of the Greek-Catholic clergy took
part in the search for a new cultural orientation. This orientation,
defined by the relative importance assigned to Eastern and Western
influences, spanned secular as well as specifically ecclesiastical
culture. Although the Stanyslaviv eparchy, where the clergy came
under the directives of Bishop Khomyshyn's own philosophy of
church and secular culture, seems to have been an exception, there
too, an attempt was made at cultural self-definition. In all three
eparchies, the Greek-Catholic clergy lived in an atmosphere in
which a new synthesis was being developed of Western and Eastern
ecclesiastical traditions, and in which a new symbiosis of sacred and
secular culture was being forged.

CHAPTER EIGHT: THE SENSE OF MISSION OF
THE GREEK-CATHOLIC PARISH PRIEST
The reform of the Greek-Catholic clergy in Galicia contributed
to a new sense of national, political, cultural and even religious
identity. Along with this new identity came a new sense of mission.
The Greek-Catholic priest was conscious of his special role both in
Galician Ukrainian society and in the greater plan of the Catholic
Church in the East. Before the mission of the clergy could be
clarified, however, its relationship to the activity of the Ukrainian
secular intelligentsia had to be worked out. In particular, the activist
clergy were faced with a practical and ideological challenge from the
Ukrainian nationalist movement. Their response to this challenge
was to propose an alternative (though not necessarily exclusive)
scenario: the vision of church Union, expressed in martial imagery
that echoed the militant spirit of contemporary nationalism. Only a
response that transcended the nationalist programme in scope and
appeal could re-establish Church and clergy as leaders of Galician
Ukrainian society.
1. Clergy and Intelligentsia: Cooperation or Competition?
John-Paul Himka, citing Miroslav Hroch, maintains that like
the clergy in other national movements, the Ukrainian Greek-
Catholic clergy played a major role in the early stages of the
Ukrainian movement, but gradually lost the lead to the secular
intelligentsia. 753 However, Himka goes on to state that while the
Greek-Catholic Church did withdraw somewhat from the national
movement, in doing so it re-affirmed the spirituality that had
suffered during in the period of the clergy's heavy social involvement.
This enabled it to maintain a position of moral leadership.
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi succeeded, he writes, "in restoring the
Himka, John-Paul. "Priests and Peasants: the Greek Catholic Pastor
and the Ukrainian National Movement in Austria, 1867-1900," Canadian
Slavonic Papers (Ottawa) vol. XXI, no. 1, reprinted in The Greek Catholic
Church and Ukrainian Society in Austrian Galicia. Cambridge, Massachusetts,
1986, 1. Contemporary observers indeed felt that the secular intelligentsia had
taken over the leadership of the Ukrainian movement. Having said, this,
however, Doroshenko points out that in the inter-war period the Church again
assumed a leading role in national life. Doroshenko 25.
234
Ukrainian Catholic church as an independent moral and spiritual
authority, allied to the national movement, but separate and
critical."754
This re-orientation of a secularised Church losing its grasp on
the national movement to a position of moral leadership required a
reformation of the clergy involving, as has been seen, a new
emphasis on spiritual formation as well as a clear sense of direction.
In forming its sense of direction, the clergy was forced to decide how
it would regard the rising secular intelligentsia that had taken over
the leadership of the national movement. Should it compete with the
intelligentsia, or seek to cooperate? How this question was
approached on the parish level, particularly with regard to the
control of the reading-rooms, has already been discussed in some
detail in Chapter Five. In this section more general clerical opinions
on relations with the secular intelligentsia will be examined.
The Greek-Catholic clergy entered the twentieth century with
a consciousness of its past contributions to the development of
Ruthenian society and a desire to continue in its leading role despite
opposition from anti-clerical circles of the intelligentsia. At the L'viv
Provincial Synod of 1891 it was noted that future priests were to be
"the light of the world and the salt of the earth and the leaders of the
people." 755 In the published proceedings of the Peremyshi' eparchial
synod of 1898 it was remarked that the Greek-Catholic priest must
continue to educate himself, "as the representative of his high state,
as a teacher and leader of the people." 756 Responding to a letter from
the Reading-room Society of the Lviv seminary in 1899 or 1900 Marko
Murava, a priest and poet who had studied at the seminary nearly
thirty years earlier, wrote that in the anti-clerical atmosphere of the
time the clergy had to make special efforts to maintain their
leadership of society:
It seems that we must achieve our position
among the people through unceasing labour --
and defend ourselves from the attacks of the
worldly and the calumnies of the callous
through learning. We must join in with every

enterprise consciously, so that we might achieve
the heights in every field of knowledge, lest we be
accused of ignorance and laziness... ."757
Rev. Evstakhii Tsurkovs'kyi, writing in Nyva in 1911,
reminded his fellow priests that it was the Greek-Catholic clergy
which had initiated the Ruthenian revival, organised education and
social, economic and political life, created the Ruthenian
intelligentsia, and established stores, banks, village cooperatives,
reading-rooms, and so on. Such "clericalism," he argued, did not
serve merely the narrow interests of a "caste." It had made it possible
for the Ruthenians to resist the initiatives of the Galician viceroy
Badeni and the Poles. To defeat the Ruthenians, however, the Poles
were now using the Radicals in the task of "breaking respect for the
clergy as leaders of the people" and destroying the cooperation
between the priests and the populists. Thus, he wrote, the close ties
between clergy and people would be sundered, and the clergy would
lose its role as leader of the people -- a result desired by the Poles and
the Ruthenian Radicals alike.758
In his article on the Lviv seminarians between 1900 and 1913,
written at the end of the latter year, Osyp Ostashevs'kyi stated that
"the development of our people, of our educational and economic
organisation, and nearly all our national achievements up to now we
owe to a great extent to the clergy, and for a long time yet the future
development of our people will depend on the attitudes which the
young clergy will take with them when they leave the walls of the
theological seminary." 759 An appeal "To the Ukrainian Clergy"
which appeared in Nyva in 1916 referred to "the glorious reputation
for patriotism and the reputation of leaders of the people which the
Ukrainian clergy has earned." 760 In 1935 Rev. Dr. Lev Hlynka,
advocating in Nyva the creation of a new organisation for the
priests of the Galician province, called for a renewed activism by the
clergy "as the leading class of Ukrainian society," which was to

struggle against the evils besetting "the Ukrainian Catholic Church
and the Ukrainian people." 76 ' Thus, throughout the development of
Ukrainian national consciousness between the turn of the century
and the 1930s, the clergy's sense of its role in society -- past, present,
and future -- remained constant.
What exactly did leadership of Galician Ukrainian society
entail? A priest writing in 1916 argued that improvements in the
education of the clergy would demonstrate that they were, or should
be, bearers of Ukrainian culture among their own people, and would
make them the guardians of this culture. 762 Bidding farewell to the
departing students of the L'viv seminary around 1924, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi reminded them of the lack of thorough religious
education among the laity, and pointed to the superior religious
upbringing of the laity of other countries as an example to be
followed.763 One specific form of Western-style pastoral work was the
Catholic Action movement, held up as an example by the editors of
Nyva in 1937. The Greek-Catholic parish priest, they wrote, would
have to go beyond the church and into society in order to fulfill his
mission effectively. He would have to be sensitive to the pulse of
society and sufficiently flexible to react to every development. He
would have to work in social organisations, side by side with the
secular intelligentsia. This would enable the Greek-Catholic clergy,
following the example of the Polish clergy, to take national life into its
hands, remaining always in the front ranks of each lay organisation.
Thus it would lead the people not only to its eternal goal, but also "to
earthly prosperity, to temporal happiness, and to the attainment of
national ideals":
We are a stateless nation; we have few leaders
with a clearly developed world view based fully
on Christian faith and morals; for this reason,
until recently in all our national institutions
there reigned a liberal, rationalist spirit. That

today the situation is better is to the credit of the
Church and the circumstance that today's
intelligentsia throughout the world has turned to
God, to eternal truths, to Christian ideals. And
do we priests dare to leave this leading class of
the people, which is seeking God and longs for
eternal truths, alone,without leadership, without
the signposts which it is seeking, perhaps as yet
unconsciously, in its national work?!
