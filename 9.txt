           a skinny horse. And soon, very soon, a poor priest
must fall into debt. He needs a pasture, and fire-
wood, and straw, and something from the
garden, and there's the mill, the road, and a fish
at carolling-time, a hare for Christmas, and
many other little things. And the stranger will
very gladly give him all this, if only they see that
his own people are refusing him. Payment will
be taken care of somehow... And with the
impoverishment of the priest there must follow
the decline of religion, as we see in deepest
Russia, and the decline of civilised life in the
community. The decline of benign pride and
loftiness of spirit in a priest is reflected in the
community, and the community loses its dignity
and integrity, and slowly becomes the slave of its
enemies.392
In October 1933 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi wrote to the Ministry
of Religious Cults and Public Education that for years, he had been
receiving smaller amounts from the Ministry for clerical salaries

than what was indicated in the receipts. He referred to "the difficult
situation" of his clergy, especially the parish priests, who for years
had been in heavy arrears for taxes as a result of "the catastrophic
decline of the agricultural economy and the decrease in income of
the entire society and especially the peasantry."393
The poverty of the clergy was acute in the mountainous Lemko
region of the Peremyshl' eparchy. In 1933 Fr. Vasyl' Seredovych,
assistant priest at Lypovets', wrote to the Peremyshi' episcopal
consistory asking to be transferred. He had been at Lypovets' for one
year, "in extreme poverty." His daily diet consisted of potatoes and
bread. He described his life as no different from that of the poorest
peasant. He was in debt for his clothes and maintenance. The parish
yielded no sacramental fees. In addition, he had experienced
misunderstandings and conflict with the parish priest. 394 In the
same year Fr. Vasyl' Kondrats'kyi, parish priest in Turie Horishne
for the previous three years, asked to be transferred to the lowlands.
"The well-known hardship in the mountains, hunger, lack of
sufficient support, lack of pastoral work, and solitude, lead the
undersigned to declare that he no longer has the strength to stay in
Turie," he wrote to the episcopal consistory in Peremyshl'.395
The problem was not limited to the Lemko region. In
December 1934, Fr. Omelian Kvit wrote in Nyva that Ukrainians in
Galicia were "all" poor, especially those with families, priests and
laity alike. For example, they could not afford to send their children
to secondary school or university. However, he remarked that some
priests complained too much and were too passive. He exhorted them
to subscribe to newspapers and read books lest they become
spiritually as well as materially impoverished, and ineffective in
their pastoral work.396
In January 1935 Fr. Vasyl' Pryshliak wrote in Nyva that five
priests had joined the clerical Society of St. Andrew because they
needed the material aid that membership afforded. He complained
that the clergy of the province had not taken "decisive steps towards
securing their own and their families' material existence,
broadening and deepening pastoral work at the grass roots, or even

maintaining their positions in civic cultural-educational and
economic life."397
In June 1939 a priest speaking at a meeting of the Komarno
deanery referred to the hard conditions of the day, particularly the
impoverishment of the peasantry. He stressed that priests must
share the effects of the economic crisis with the people.398
Church Administration
As in the Austrian period, the church administration required
deans to hold soborchyky or deanery meetings on a regular basis. In
1930 the official bulletin of the Peremyshl' eparchy reminded deans
that they were to send a report of each meeting to the episcopal
ordinariat, along with the minutes of the meeting and a copy of each
talk given, as required by the rules of the 1898 eparchial synod. It also
urged them to discuss primarily current topics and practical
problems. The ordinariat was to approve the programme of each
meeting in advance.399
It appears that in the Peremyshl' eparchy at least, the church
authorities required detailed information on a priest applying for a
vacant benefice. The form submitted by the Zhovkva deanery office to
the episcopal ordinariat in February 1937 concerning Fr. Petro
Skavyns'kyi, the administrator at Smerekiv, who sought permanent
appointment to that benefice, included questions concerning the
priest's participation in deanery meetings, the frequency with which
he heard confession, his family life, his relations with the
parishioners and with other priests, his punctuality, and his
participation (if any) in civic and political life. The dean noted that
Fr. Skavyns'kyi enjoyed the favour of both the Ukrainians and the
Ruthenians in the village.400 Generally speaking, it appears that like
his predecessor Syl'vester Sembratovych (1885-1898), Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi gave preference in the assignment of parishes to priests
of a Ukrainian orientation.401

As under Austria, a priest could only be removed from his
parish for good cause. In a number of cases, priests were asked by
the L'viv metropolitan curia to resign from their parishes. In two
such cases in 1931, the Ternopil' (Tarnopol) governor informed the
Ministry of Religious Cults that the curia was forcing the
resignation of priests who did not agree with its militantly
Ukrainian nationalist line. In a third case from that year, the priest
himself, a supporter of the Non-Party Bloc for Cooperation with the
Government (BBWR), blamed Ukrainian National-Democrats for
organising a campaign against him, and asked the Ministry to help
him retain his parish, which he had held since 1909.402
In the Lemko Apostolic Administration, however, a priest
could be disciplined for virtually the opposite reasons. In February
1936 Fr. Ivan Kachmar was suspended "ab officio et beneficio" for
having incurred the hatred of his parishioners in Zlots'ke.
According to a May 1936 report by the vicar capitular in charge of the
Administration, Zlots'ke was one of the parishes where a priest of a
Ukrainian orientation, guided by political rather than religious
motives, had through his activity driven his Lemko faithful into the
arms of the Orthodox or Protestants.403
Secular Administration
The Polish government's attitude towards the Greek-Catholic
Church has been characterised as polite but distrustful. The
detention of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi in Poznafi in 1923, motivated
by the authorities' reservations concerning his attitude towards the
new Polish state and its claim to Eastern Galicia, 404 set the tone for
their relations with his clergy.
Political considerations were paramount in the government's
attitude towards the Greek-Catholic Church. However, no clear
policy was ever formulated to deal with the nationalities question. As
a recent legal commentator has said, "All the weaknesses of the
nationalities policy found their reflection in the government's

religious policy." Unable to resolve the major national and religious
problems with which it was faced, the government of inter-war
Poland limited itself to discussing secondary matters with small
groups of clergy inclined to compromise, which only resulted in
alienating other groups of clergy and laity.405
This irresolute, ad hoc approach left room for abuses on the
local level, which alienated both clergy and laity. An anonymous
brochure first published in L'viv in 1925, but dealing primarily with
events in the Peremyshi' eparchy, described the situation in these
words:
In the church area, good priests are refused
[canonical] institution in their parishes without
valid reasons; though without fault, they are
removed from permanent positions; and they are
harassed by all sorts of administrative
directives. And recently, when the priests'
society of St. Paul the Apostle brought a
grievance before the League of Nations for the
wrongs done to their brethren, it was
dissolved.406
This passage may refer, like much of the brochure, to alleged
abuses by the bishop as well as by the secular authorities. In fact, the
brochure hints broadly that the bishop was being manipulated by the
state authorities into pursuing action detrimental to the lower clergy
and the Ukrainian people in general.
Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv, an enemy of
militant Ukrainian nationalism often accused of being too
conciliatory towards the Polish authorities, nevertheless complained
publicly of the latter's treatment of his priests. The local
administration harassed the Greek-Catholic clergy, he wrote on 10
September 1930, and treated them insultingly. Laying down a set of
guidelines for his clergy in dealing with the civil authorities, he
called on them to defend their rights and their dignity, without being

The quoted passage was censored from the 1925 brochure "Zakhody kolo
vvedennia tselibatu v nashim dukhovenstvi," published in L'viv, but was
introduced into the record of the Sejm on 15 May 1925 by the Ukrainian club of
deputies as interpellation No. 456 addressed to the Minister of Justice. As part of
the legislative record, this and other passages could then be published, which they
were when the brochure was re-issued as an appendix to the work cited at the
beginning of this note. This tactic was common in cases of press censorship.

disloyal, whenever the state organs abused their authority. If
necessary, priests should appeal to the highest authorities, and if
that failed, they should inform the episcopal ordinariat and make the
matter publicly known, even resisting the civil authorities if
necessary. Bishop Khomyshyn reminded his priests to behave
correctly in such situations and to maintain their dignity, never
losing their emotional equilibrium or allowing themselves to be
provoked. They must remain polite, but not obsequious. They should
not participate in events where they would only serve as decoration
or would be humiliated. In characteristically down-to-earth fashion
the Bishop, a peasant's son, observed that the Polish authorities "are
ready to regard and treat us as would a gentleman who pets a little
dog for standing up on its hind legs and turning tricks."407
Police surveillance of the activities of Greek-Catholic priests
appears to have continued throughout the period. In May 1939 the
parish priest at Mistkovychi in the Peremyshl' eparchy was asked by
the local police official to explain the planned meeting of priests in
his village and to provide the names and places of residence of the
participants. As it turned out, the gathering was a regular meeting
of the Sambir deanery.408
A regular point of contact between the government authorities
and the clergy was the collection of taxes. Under article 15 of the
Concordat, clergy were subject to taxes equally with laity. 409 In
practice, the Greek-Catholic clergy were subject to heavy and often
unjustified taxation. In particular, the road-tax and property tax
were often imposed in excessive amounts. Appeals were usually
futile.410
As in the Austrian period, but to a greater extent, the main
point of friction between the Greek-Catholic parish clergy and the
government administration concerned the language in which parish
records were kept and in which extracts therefrom, as well as
relevant correspondence, were written. Of particular importance
was the form of surnames (e.g., Ukrainian "Szeptyc'kyj" or Polish
"Szeptycki"). The Polish authorities required that parish records be

kept in Latin. They based their right to demand this on the fact that
parish records were of a public, legal character. However, this
demand was often ignored, even by the highest Greek-Catholic
authorities. On two occasions, the metropolitan curia in L'viv
recommended that parish records should be kept in the Ukrainian
language.411
In 1926 Bishop losafat Kotsylovs'kyi of Peremyshi' appealed an
order of Minister Stanislaw Grabski of 9 April 1926 regarding the use
of Polish in correspondence with state authorities to the Supreme
Administrative Tribunal. The Minister claimed that the language
law of 31 July 1924 did not afford the Greek-Catholic authorities the
right to use a non-state language in correspondence with the higher
state authorities. The Tribunal decided in 1928 that the matter was
not ripe for adjudication, since according to the Ministry of Religious
Cults, Grabski's order was in fact not a directive or decision but
merely an opinion, which had not bound or damaged the petitioner
because it had not been applied to him.412
In his 1930 appeal to his priests, Bishop Khomyshyn of
Stanyslaviv noted that they often complained to him of the fines and
jail sentences imposed on them for carrying on correspondence and
keeping records in the Ukrainian language. He pointed out that a
priest was not merely a state functionary, since he was appointed to
his office by church rather than state authorities, did not take an
oath of office to the state, was not dedicated exclusively to state
service, did not receive sufficient pay to live from such service alone
and in fact was not really being paid to keep records but in
compensation for church property taken by the state. As a res mixta,
the parish record office was subject to requirements of both church
and state; nevertheless, the priest was not a state official and thus not
bound by the law of 31 July 1924 nor the executive order of 24
September 1924 to use Polish as the language of all official
correspondence. Bishop Khomyshyn further pointed out that on 11
December 1928 the Supreme Administrative Tribunal had
overturned the sentence of a L'viv priest who had written out an
extract from parish records in Ukrainian, on the ground that

125
Minister Stanistaw Grabski's order of 9 April 1926 contradicted
existing law and had never been legally promulgated. Nevertheless,
since fines or arrests were continuing, Bishop Khomyshyn laid down
the following norms: (1) parish records should be kept in Latin, (2)
extracts for administrative and judicial authorities of the first and
second instance should be provided in Ukrainian and for authorities
of the third instance as well as military authorities in Polish, (3)
correspondence with authorities of the first and second instance
should be in Ukrainian and with those of the third instance or the
military in Polish, (4) while the state administrative authorities may
inspect these records, they must not be allowed to take them away
without the agreement of the episcopal ordinariat, (5) the seal of the
parish office should be in Ukrainian and should be used on records,
and (6) letters addressed to the "civilian record office" should be
returned or sent to the episcopal ordinariat, because such an office
did not exist in any parish.413
The L'viv metropolitan consistory, and particularly Bishop
Ivan Buchko, defended the parish priests before the civil
authorities. 414 As late as 1939, the Ministry of Internal Affairs
expressed its annoyance to the Ministry of Religious Cults that the
Peremyshi' Greek-Catholic episcopal consistory had gone so far as to
use the "Ruthenian" language in correspondence regarding a birth
certificate with the local civil authorities in a town in Pozna/i county.
It pointed out that the Polish language must be used in all
correspondence with civil authorities and offices beyond the L'viv,
Ternopil', Stanyslaviv, Volhynia (Wo1yr1) and Polissia (Polesie)
counties.415
The language of correspondence or of parish records was
perhaps less of a burning issue than the form in which surnames
were entered in those records, since a name could be entered in
either a Polish or a Ukrainian form regardless of whether one used
the Latin, Polish or even Ukrainian language. Changing the form of
a surname was regarded as tantamount to changing the nationality
of its bearer. Whether such a change constituted the adoption of a

126
foreign nationality or merely a return to that of one's ancestors was
often a matter of dispute. It was natural for a priest baptising a
person in the Latin rite to spell his name in its Polish form, and for a
priest baptising a person in the Greek rite to render the name in a
Ukrainian form.
In the Stanyslaviv eparchy, it was reported in 1938 that Fr.
Vasyl' Maksymyk of the Rohatyn district had Ukrainianised over 550
Polish surnames in the parish records. The matter was referred to
the procuracy. 416 In March of the following year, it was reported that
an official of the Rohatyn district administration had inspected the
records at eleven Greek-Catholic parish offices and had confirmed
that at every office Polish surnames had been Ukrainianised. This
matter was referred to the courts as a criminal case, and the offices
were directed to correct the improper entries in the records. Fr. Petro
Tkachivs'kyi, parish priest at Han'kivtsi in the Sniatyn district, had
presented to the community administration in Zadubrovtsi a birth
certificate in which the surname urakowski had been altered to the
Ukrainian form Zurakowskyj. The local police referred this matter to
the procurator at the regional court in Kolomyia for further action.417
At a meeting of the clergy of the Stara Sil' deanery on 6 June
1939, the discussion of current affairs centered on the trials and
sentences imposed on priests in connection with parish records. In
that year, three priests of the deanery had been penalised by
suspended sentences of from six to eight months, and two others had
been released after trial. The members of the deanery asked the
episcopal ordinariat to defend them before the appropriate
authorities.418
The legal context in which the Greek-Catholic clergy
functioned did not change drastically after the fall of Austria, if only
because the Polish regime did not succeed in replacing the
sophisticated Austrian ecclesiastical legislation with a
comprehensive and effective system. Church administration
remained fairly constant throughout the period under study, but
friction between the clergy and the secular authorities increased
under Polish rule. The economic situation saw the greatest change,

127
due to the ravages of the world war, the problems of the Polish
economy, and the recession of the 1930s.
It is difficult to characterise the economic state of the Greek-
Catholic clergy. Although there seems to have been a real worsening
after World War One, the clergy's own accounts of its economic
status in relation to the rest of society cannot be expected to be
altogether impartial. The fact that the social complexion of this
group changed during the period under study, as discussed in the
next chapter, is a complicating factor. Yet the objective level of wealth
or poverty of the Greek-Catholic clergy is less important here than its
perception of that level. This perception was bound up with the
parish priests' attitudes on various religious, political and cultural
questions, which will be discussed in Chapters Six and Seven. As
will be seen in the final chapter, it was also an element of their view
of their social and historical mission.
CHAPTER FOUR: THE CLERICAL ESTATE
In addition to the legal and administrative strictures and the
economic pressures discussed in the previous chapter, the Greek-
Catholic parish priest lived and worked in the midst of a web of
human relationships. First, there was the inner circle of
relationships: with his family, which in some cases was part of a
virtual priestly dynasty; with his fellow priests, who formed a special
class within society; with his bishop, who ordained him and to whom
he was responsible; and to a limited extent, with the clergy of the
Latin rite. These relationships, and the changes which they
underwent during the period under study, will be discussed in this
chapter. Beyond the inner circle were the parish, and society in
general. The priest's relationships with this outer circle will be
discussed in Chapter Five.
1. Exclusivity
Both Polish and Ukrainian sources have claimed that in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the Greek-Catholic
clergy in Galicia constituted something of a caste. In large priestly
families, Sons followed in their fathers' footsteps. 419 Fr. Isydor
Sokhots'kyi wrote in retrospect that this closed social class cultivated
Ukrainian traditions. 420 Writing in 1911, the Polish priest Fr. Jozef
Borodzicz contrasted the Latin-rite clergy, which like Meichizedek
was called to the priesthood, with the Greek-rite clergy, which like
Aaron simply inherited it.421 An anonymous author writing in the
"Gazeta Kocielna" in the following year characterised the Greek-
Catholic clergy as a "caste" -- closed in upon itself, conservative,
jealous of its material interests, bound up with the family, and
worldlly.422
Upon completing seminary, a candidate who wished to marry
had to do so before ordination. It was customary for such a person to

immediately set about to find a wife, usually the daughter of a
priest. 423 Of a number of marriage certificates of candidate priests in
the archive of the Peremyshl' eparchy from 1900-1901, nearly all
indicate that the candidate, whether the son of a priest or a peasant,
married a priest's daughter. 424 In his memoirs, Fr. Tyt
Voinarovs'kyi recounts that having completed his studies in 1878 at
the age of 22, he had two years before he could be ordained, and thus
could travel about the province visiting families with eligible
daughters. He finally married a priest's daughter in 1880, was
ordained at the beginning of the following year, and about a month
later began his duties as assistant priest to his father-in-law. A little
over a year later, after his wife's untimely death, he became assistant
priest to his wife's grandfather at Kolodiivka near Stanyslaviv.425
The custom of intermarriage among priestly families
naturally led to the formation of a caste. In the nineteenth century,
this had constituted the one coherent educated elite of Galician
Ruthenian society, though in the final decades a secular
intelligentsia consisting mostly of professionals (particularly
lawyers) began to assert itself. The clergy were generally regarded as
a higher class. Fr. 0. Prystai recounts that as a secondary school
student in the 1880s he fretted about spending his summer holiday at
the home of a priest because he did not have the requisite manners
and polish. 426 The memoirs of the priest's son and politician Evhen

the L'viv seminary in 1902-1904 he had observed that "the final weeks of the
school year at the seminary were very difficult in terms of maintaining student
discipline, because no one was occupied with his studies, no one prepared
properly for examinations or prepared his soul for the priesthood, but for
marriage.., nearly every seminarian had the addresses of all the married
priests who had daughters or of other persons who the seminarians knew had
eligible girls; it was towards this, and not towards their theological studies, that
their minds were turned." Mel'nychuk, Petro. Vladvka Hrvhorii Khomvshvn.

130
Olesnyts'kyi contain a vivid picture of clerical life in the Stryi area in
the 1890s, contrasting it with that of the clergy in Podillia (Podolie) to
the east:
In the villages, the entire strength of the
Ukrainian intelligentsia of the district lay in the
clergy. There was much of it, but it did not
present a very happy sight. True, here there was
no aristocratic clericalism, as in Podillia. The
local clergy generally consisted of good people
who were hospitable and kind-hearted in their
social relations -- and that was all. Social life was
possible and pleasant here. Gatherings and
receptions at priests' homes had a different
character here than in Podillia. There,
everything was puffed up and full of the
consciousness of one's high dignity, sycophantic
towards higher ranks and haughty towards
lower ones. Here there were people who had not
become overly accustomed to haughty thinking,
rather being eager for merriment with a drink
or at cards. The latter flourished especially in the
mountains around Skolie, where famous
specialists appeared, especially in the game of
ferbel'. There were not many interested in
serious debate, and still fewer in serious
systematic work, although -- as it later turned
out -- there were people here who given good
leadership knew how to set to work and
accomplish something good after all. Altogether
it was harder to find serious thought or initiative
among these people than blind obedience, which
they never denied to whoever knew how to win
their confidence.427
Olesnyts'kyi goes on to describe the priest Fr. V. Davydiak, an
energetic and resourceful man, well-educated and well-read, who
like most priests in the area was a Russophile but who unlike most
Russophiles of the time was not an obscurantist, and did not shun
Ukrainian publications. He was also an excellent conversationalist,
distinguished by his pleasant manners, friendliness and wit, who
"knew how to enjoy himself." In fact he was adept at cards, won a
good deal of money, and was known in Skolie as the "king of ferbel'."

Olesnyts'kyi also describes Fr. Lev Shankovs'kyi, parish priest at
Duliby and dean at Stryi, who was sincere, generous, very hospitable
and very merry in company, and at whose house there were always
guests. Though a Russophile at heart, he kept his beliefs to himself
and lived well with both Ukrainians and Poles. Fr. Shankovs'kyi and
Fr. Volodymyr Martynkiv, dean at Skolie, made a jolly pair in society,
and both could joke, sing, and dance; indeed, "it seemed that they
could make a dead man happy." At the same time they were not fit
for public life, and no one expected that they should be.428
The Greek-Catholic priestly "caste" was heavily Old
Ruthenian in cultural orientation, with occasional Russophile
tendencies bordering on the political, as will be discussed in Chapter
Six. What is relevant here is the fact that the demise of the Old
Ruthenians and Russophiles in the first decades of the twentieth
century coincided with the demise of the priestly caste. It would
appear that this group underwent social as well as ideological
extinction.
A rough picture of the demise of the priestly caste can be
drawn by counting the number of family names that appear with a
given frequency in the "schematisms" or registers of priests and
parishes of the three Galician eparchies at different points in the
forty-year span between 1900 and 1939. Although one cannot assume
that several priests with the same surname, particularly a common
one, will be related, it is reasonable to suppose that a surname
appearing five or more times in the schematism of a given eparchy
in most cases will belong to a priestly family. Comparing the
schematisms for the Peremyshi' eparchy for 1896 and 1934, and those
for the L'viv archeparchy for 1897 and 1932-1933, one finds that (1) the
absolute number of surnames appearing five or more times in the
schematism decreased sharply in each case (from 22 to 8 in
Peremyshl', from 24 to 6 in L'viv), (2) the "disappearing" families
were not replaced, "new" families appearing with the same
frequency being very few (only four "new" family names appeared
five or more times in the 1934 Peremyshl' schematism, only three
"new" names in the 1932-1933 L'viv schematism). 429 In the 1936

schematism for the Lemko Apostolic Administration (created in
1934), despite the fact that the Lemko area was known for its large
priestly families, only one surname appears more than three
times 430
An example of a priestly clan that gradually disappeared from
the clergy altogether is the Korosten's'kyi family, two members of
which already appear in the Peremyshi' schematism of 1828. In the
nineteenth century they intermarried with the I1'nyts'kyi and
Levyts'kyi families, both well represented in the Peremyshi'
eparchial clergy. The 1879 schematism lists five members of the
Korostens'kyi family, the 1896 schematism, four. All these were
married or widowed. Three appear in the 1902 schematism, but none
in 1928 or 1929. The last family members in the priesthood appear to
have been two brothers (both members of the Kachkovs'ky Society and
therefore presumably Old Ruthenians) who died in 1921 and 1926.
What happened to the sons of such families? Many entered
other professions; some entered politics. Such prominent Galician
Ukrainian politicians as Oleksander Barvins'kyi (1847-1927), Evhen
Olesnyts'kyi (1860-1917), Kost' Levyts'kyi (1859-1941) and the Western
Ukrainian dictator Evhen Petrushevych (1863-1940) came from
clerical families. 432 The same is true of prominent individuals born
somewhat later, such as the composer Filiaret Kolessa (1871-1947),
the politician Dmytro Paliiv (1896-1944), and the nationalist leaders
Stepan Bandera (1909-1959) and Iaroslav Stets'ko (1912-1986). The
