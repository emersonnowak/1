Sheptyts'kyi's 1901 pastoral letter, the Rules of the L'viv seminary
and the its expansion in the 1920s to the status of academy, also
affected the Peremyshl' and Stanyslaviv seminaries. Bishop

closely supervised his diocesan seminary at Stanyslaviv. Bishop
Kotsylovs'kyi, who oversaw the expansion of his seminary at
Peremyshi', was a Basilian who had taught at Stanyslaviv. The
general tenor of seminary life appears to have been the same at L'viv,
Stanyslaviv and Peremyshi', except that with jts elevation to the
status of academy, the L'viv seminary afforded much greater
educational opportunities.
The reform was aimed at improving the status of the Greek-
Catholic clergy, in the sense of both their real abilities and their
image in Ruthenian-Ukrainian society. Discipline, asceticism and
spiritual guidance would produce better priests. A broader
intellectual outlook would produce clergymen that could compete
successfully with the secular and often anti-clerical intelligentsia for
influence among the masses. Extra-curricular activity would
prepare seminarians for the secular organisational life in which
they would participate as pastors, and thus help to break down the
barrier between clergy and laity. Outside interests, and a better
familiarity with the niceties of social life (including conduct and
manners) would help the priests establish stronger ties with the
growing Ukrainian middle class as well as the peasants. A spirit of
self-sacrifice would prepare candidate priests for the challenge of
promoting the Union in the East. The decline of Russophilism (see
Chapter Six) and the entry of peasants' sons into the seminary
probably facilitated these reforms.
Such a transformation of seminary, seminarians and
ultimately of clergy would have to be an inner transformation for the
individuals involved. Such an inner metamorphosis inevitably would
be reflected in what Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi called the "spirit of the
institution" (dukh z pklpdu). This in turn would work to transform a
gymnasium student into a priest -- indeed, Sheptyts'kyi felt that the
spirit of the institution could do more in this regard than all the
prefects. 256 This spirit could be described as the sum of "the desires,
goals, abilities, general opinion, general feeling about learning and
piety, the average degree of conscientiousness in fulfilling
obligations, the average level of studiousness." The spirit of a good
seminary was "generally correct views on the work and obligations of
a priest, on the tasks of the Church, a general eagerness among the
256   Szeptycki, List Dasterski 15.
81
seminarians to undertake this work, and a strong desire to work to
gain whatever was necessary to do this work." 257
It is impossible to discover or recreate the spirit that informed
the L'viv, Stanyslaviv and Peremyshl' seminaries between the 1890s
and the 1930s. The facts adduced above provide only a hint of what
that spirit might have been like. Some idea may be gained, however,
in examining the attitudes of the seminarians themselves. The
sources provide a rather skewed picture of these attitudes, since they
mostly concern politics and the issue of priestly celibacy -- an issue
that involved spirituality and discipline as well as social and political
considerations. However, it was the semnarians' attitudes on
precisely these topics that determined in great part the
consciousness of the Greek-Catholic clergy between 1900 and 1939.

CHAPTER TWO: STUDENT ATTITUDES
1. Politics and Society
Even before the reform of the L'viv seminary, some of its
students at least were concerned with the social problems
confronting the Greek-Catholic clergy. Around 1897 the
announcement of a new secular publication, the Literaturno-
Naukovyi Vistnyk, to be edited by a board including Ivan Franko,
prompted a group of clerics from Oles'ko to publish a response in the
publication Dushpastyr. Franko, after all, was known for his anti-
clerical views. The Oles'ko clerics called on all priests belonging to
the Shevchenko Scholarly Society to prevent anti-religious articles
from being printed in the Vistnyk, or else to leave the Society. The
Reading-room Society at the L'viv seminary agreed with the Oles'ko
clerics, and sent a letter to that effect to the Society.258
Whatever the outcome of this incident may have been, it
illustrates the L'viv seminarians' concern with meeting the
challenge posed by the lay intelligentsia. Their relationship with the
secular world, however, was not adverse in all respects. On the issue
of the creation of a "Ukrainian-Ruthenian" university, for example,
the seminarians saw eye to eye with their lay colleagues at the
University. In the academic year 1899-1900, which seminarian
Iaroslav Levyts'kyi considered "a significant year for the entire
Ukrainian youth," a public meeting on the university question was
held, Moloda Ukraina was published, and the secular student
hromada became "the heart of all young Ukrainians." "The
influence of the first viche [public meeting] and of the work of their
secular friends could not but affect the young theology students too,"
recalled Levyts'kyi a year later. There was intense activity as the
seminarians worked to improve themselves and each other. At the
Reading-room Circle there were discussions:
The somnolence of the Ruthenian clergy was
criticised -- its indifference to the newest trends
hostile to the faith, its horror at the scholarly
printed book, etc. The ideal, the goal of these
Circle members was for the time being the
hard-working candidate, proper in every respect,

and in the future an even better Catholic priest
and populist.259
Not all these attitudes were shared by the rest of the
seminarians. The Russophiles had different concerns. Nor did all of
Galician society share the combination of Ukrainophile and Catholic
views held by Levyts'kyi and his colleagues. When official Russian
celebrations of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 1875 conversion of
the Uniates in the Kholm (Chehn) region to Orthodoxy sparked a
protest by the seminarians, the response in Ruthenian society was
mixed." Altogether few understood the action of the young theology
students (some did not even understand individual words and signs),
and almost nobody solidarised with jt."260
In his 1913 memoir, the Rev. Osyp Ostashevs'kyi relates the
withdrawal of roughly 60 Russophile students from the Reading-
room around 1902. The Russophiles formed their own group,
profiting from the fact that the Ukrainophiles, objecting to the
rector's impartial stance, had alienated his favour. However, the
Russophiles soon annoyed the rector with their sympathies for Tsar
and Orthodoxy. During this time, "co-existence between the two
camps of seminarians was almost impossible." 261 After a Russophile
priest influenced a well-known specialist in moral theology to
denounce clerical celebrations of the Ukrainian national poet Taras
Shevchenko, the Reading-room had to reduce its activities.
Ostashevs'kyi and his colleagues were concerned about the spread of
Orthodoxy in Galicia through the work of Galician Russophiles and
through the sending of Galician children to "a school of janissaries
in autocratic Russia;" what annoyed them even more about the latter
was that it was Greek-Catholic priests who were responsible. All this
led to a major showdown between Ukrainians and Russophiles in the
seminary in 1912.262
Ostashevs'kyi complains also about the apathy still common
among his fellows. Although a few activists revived the theological
club in 1913, "in reality not many showed up at the lectures, probably
259     Levytskyi 55-56. The Rev. Osyp Ostashevs'kyi remarks in 1913 that the
importance of the "ascetic world view" and of its dissemination is still too little
understood or valued by the Greek-Catholic clergy. Ostashevs'kyi, Osyp. "Z
istoryi dukhovnoho zhytia l'vivs'kykh bohosloviv v litakh 1900-1913," in

84
because by and large, the feeling for serious scholarly work still was
not very great among them."263
Yet neither their colleagues' apathy nor Russophile hostility
could stem the growing political awareness of a number of the L'viv
seminarians, which may have had its roots in secondary school (as
in the case of Myroslav Ripets'kyi) and in any case was nourished by
contact with secular Ruthenians at the University (as related by
Iaroslav Levyts'kyi). To a degree this political awareness, and later
engagement, was a natural outgrowth of the dedication to their
people advocated by Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, who in his pastoral
letter of 1 September 1901 had directed the seminarians to come to
know their people and to care for their good, to love them and to
prepare thoroughly to work among them.264
That same autumn the new dean of the faculty of theology at
the University, the Rev. Dr. Fialek, criticised the Ruthenian
seminarians for signing up for lectures in their own language, and
directed them to use only the Polish language in all oral or written
communications with the University authorities. This naturally
offended the seminarians, for as Osyp Ostashevs'kyi put it, "they
understood that their task was not only to be good seminarians but
also good defenders and fighters for the rights of their people."
Meeting on 20 November 1901, they resolved to ignore the dean's
demand; whoever should not heed their resolution would be shunned
by his comrades "as a traitor to the popular cause." After a
delegation to Dr. Fialek brought no results, they sent a memorandum
to the Ministry of Education and telegraphed the Ukrainian
parliamentary deputies in Vienna. 265 In the meantime, the secular
studentry had been provoked by the dean of the faculty of philosophy,
who had forbidden the historian Professor Mykhailo Hrushevs'kyi to
address faculty meetings in Ukrainian. 266 They called a meeting for
noon on the 19th of November. The time of day was chosen to
accommodate the seminarians, but had not been approved by the
authorities. Among the resolutions was a call for the creation of a
263    Ostashevs'kyi 290.

Ukrainian university in L'viv. During the ensuing march, the lay
students escorted their seminary brethren home and gave them a
parting ovation. All this elicited hostile articles in the press and anti-
Ukrainian leaflets. A few days after the demonstration, an inquiry
was held, as a result of which two students were expelled from the
University. In protest, several hundred Ukrainian students left the
University on 3 December 1901, not to return until July of the
following year.267
Many of the "secessionists" -- by one account, half -- were
Greek-Catholic seminarians. 268 On hearing of this, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi informed the University rectorate that he was closing
the seminary on the next day. He provided financial support for his
students to continue their studies abroad. 269 Of these,160 transferred
to Vienna. Among them were losyf Botsiian, a future bishop; Tyt
Halushchyns'kyi, later a noted educator and Basilian
protoarchimandrite; and Ivan Liatyshevs'kyi, who was to become
suifragan bishop of Stanyslaviv.270
After the secession of 1901-1902, conflicts divided the L'viv
seminarians from their lay colleagues. They decided at a general
meeting not to participate in a rally of Ruthenian students from all
over Austria to be held on 13-14 July1903, to protest against the
resolutions to be presented there, and to terminate relations with the
lay students altogether. They felt that the students had ceased to take
the seminarians' feelings into account and indeed had begun to
ignore them. As was evident from their publications Moloda
Ukraina and Iskra, they had taken a hostile stand with regard to the
seminarians. 271 Apparently, anti-clericalism had again come to the
fore.
Yet the issue of Ukrainian-language chairs at the University
and related matters continued to provide common ground for lay and

seminary students. On 7 March 1906 the seminarians held a rally,
with the rector's approval, which sent a deputation to the academic
senate regarding violation of their linguistic rights, and demanding
a separate Ukrainian university. In December they demanded that
the academic senate permit them to take their oath of matriculation
in Ukrainian.272
The lessons that the seminarians derived from this political
experience, as related by Ostashevs'kyi, were conditioned by their
peculiar status in Galician society:
The illegality and coercion that we had long
experienced, and the experience that the
seminarians gained from common coexistence
with the secular students during and after the
secession, gave them an all too vivid proof of the
fact that only by their own efforts and by the
ceaseless labour of all those who were united by
common principles, convictions and ideals,
could they achieve something in good time, and
for this reason the idea arose among them to
organise our entire clergy and to set up an
assistance fund in order to avert material need
on behalf of young priests, and widows and
orphans of priests.273
The distancing of the L'viv seminarians from the highly
political secular studentry did not signify a retreat from politics. In
April 1908 the seminarians could only have joined Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi's condemnation of the assassination of Viceroy Potocki
by a Ukrainian student. Yet in that same year, a group of Polish
landowners wrote to the new Galician viceroy, the historian Micha
Bobrzyzski, complaining that Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's seminary
graduates were becoming less and less Christian. 274 In 1910 there
were bloody Polish-Ukrainian university disorders, particularly on 1
July. On 28 June, Sheptyts'kyi had made a speech in the House of
Lords in favour of a Ukrainian university, thus lending his prestige
to the cause. Nevertheless, in December, in the spirit of a papal

decree, the Metropolitan Ordinariat forbade the reading of political
periodicals in the seminary.275
The Ukrainian orientation of at least a substantial number of
the L'viv seminarians implied an interest in political events beyond
the confines of Galicia. Osyp Ostashevs'kyi relates that the
seminarians sought "to awaken their brothers from the other side of
the Carpathians, and together with them to stand beneath the blue-
and-yellow banner of Ukraine." Events in Russian Ukraine
interested them too. "Recently the chains of our people have been
broken," writes Ostashevs'kyi in 1913; "recently the bright sun has
risen upon the horizon of Ukraine and with its rays has pierced the
fogs of servitude, and today we bear witness to the great strides that
this people has made in such a brief time in the development of its
life." On the eve of the world war that would see the establishment of
a short-lived Ukrainian state, Ostashevs'kyi expresses the conviction
that the Greek-Catholic clergy would have an important role to play
in Ukrainian nation-building: "Today it is the desire of our people to
come up to the level of healthy western European culture; th a great
degree this task lies also upon the clergy; therefore a zeal for
energetic work for the people and the Catholic Church must grow
within us, and future generations will speak of its success."276
The political efforts of the Galician Ruthenians towards
electoral reform and a Ukrainian university proved successful only
in1914, when there was too little time to profit from their victory.
Their general impetus, of course, found expression in the
establishment of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic in the
autumn of 1918, and in the bitter Polish-Ukrainian war of the next
several months. Seminary life was interrupted, with many former
and future seminarians taking part in that struggle.277
With the establishment of the Polish state, the L'viv seminary
came under official suspicion along with other Ukrainian
institutions. Nykolai Voiakovs'kyi, a L'viv seminarian ordained in
1925, recounts that one evening in the early 1920s the seminary
rector told him that the police planned to search the seminary for a

cache of arms supposedly kept there by the conspiratorial Ukrainian
Military Organisation, and asked him and a colleague to check the
cellar. Voiakovs'kyi's search produced nothing save a dead cat, and
the police never arrived. 278 In January 1924 the L'viv police chief
wrote to the county governor, listing details concerning the political
loyalty of fourteen professors at the Greek-Catholic seminary, such
as their political activity, party affiliations, contacts with the
underground Ukrainian university, and such.279 In December 1930
the governor of Ternopil' county informed his counterpart in L'viv
(with copies to the ministries of Cults and Internal Affairs) that at
the L'viv seminary or St. George's Cathedral, a commission of
Ukrainian scholars was assembling information about that year's
pacification, to be published abroad. 280 A report to the Ministry of
Religious Cults and Public Education on Greek-Catholic clerical
agitation in favour of Carpatho-Ukraine in 1938-1939 listed four
former students of the Minor Seminary or Academy who had been
arrested and sentenced for subversive activity between 1931 and 1938,
noting that there were "many others." It also listed five current
residents of the seminary who had been sentenced for activity in the
Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists. 281 Undoubtedly the flood of
applicants unable to obtain either a job or an education elsewhere in
the 1930s imported elements into the L'viv seminary whose
orientation was more political than metaphysical. In any case, the
atmosphere was apparently so intense that according to a note of the
religious section of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of 2 August 1938
concerning a seminary for the Lemko region, "It cannot be doubted
that even a stay of a few days in Ukrainian nationalist centres, such
as the Seminaries in L'viv and Peremyshl', can exert a markedly
negative influence on immature seminarians, and this situation
must be avoided."282
The excitement over Carpatho-Ukrainian autonomy affected
the L'viv seminary in more ways than one. On the eve of 1 November

(the traditional day of celebration of the Western Ukrainian People's
Republic and the battle for L'viv) 1938, a mob attacked several
Ukrainian institutions in the city, destroying the seminary's
entrance gate, reception room and two adjoining rooms.283
The students' political convictions put the seminary
administration in a delicate position. The Rev. Volodymyr Pelekh
recounts that when, as a second-year seminarian, he was called for
military registration around 1932 or 1933, he refused to speak with
the officer in Polish, and was duly arrested. On the next day the
rector, Rev. losyf Slipyj, had to come to liberate him and after some
pertractations with the military authorities obtained an exemption
based on physical disability for his perfectly healthy charge.284
The extent of nationalist convictions among the L'viv
seminarians of the inter-war period is difficult to quantify, but it is
relevant that the old acrimonious party divisions between
Russophiles and Ukrainians were a thing of the past. Pelekh relates
that in his time (1931-1936), "Common life among the students was
pleasant and civilised..."285
In 1901 the L'viv seminarian Iaroslav Levyts'kyi wrote, "...we
have hope in God that our seminary will some day be an example for
other institutions." 286 Did the seminarians of Peremyshi' and
Stanyslaviv follow their L'viv colleagues in the development of their
attitudes?
Aside from the celibacy issue, which will be discussed below,
there is no readily available information on prevailing attitudes in
the Stanyslaviv seminary. 287 There is not much more regarding
Peremyshl'. 288 An unsigned, undated manuscript, evidently
