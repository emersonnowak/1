However, the Russophilism of the Old Ruthenians was
primarily a cultural movement, rarely involving religious apostasy
or political disloyalty. 606 In part it was a reaction against the Polish
cultural orientation that much of the Ruthenian Greek-Catholic
clergy had adopted in previous decades. In part it was an attempt to
stave off poloriisation in both the secular and church domains in an
era of Polish dominance in virtually all spheres of Galician life.607
The movement set up its own network of reading-rooms under the
auspices of the Kachkovsky Society, set up in 1874. It was culturally
conservative, however, in the sense that it favoured using the
"etymological" rather than the phonetic orthography. This was also
a reflection of its politically conservative, anti-populist stance. Rather
than seeking to write in a manner that conveyed popular speech, the
Old Ruthenians used an artificial written language incorporating
elements of Church Slavonic and Russian. Incomprehensible to the
masses (and comical to the new secular intelligentsia), it became the
written language of much of the priestly class well into the twentieth
century. In the strictly religious sphere, Russophilism included a
movement for purification of the Greek-Catholic rite, which at least
since the Synod of Zamoé in 1720 had undergone gradual
606     At a February 1912 meeting of the Zhovkva (Zdlkiew) deanery -- one of the
extraordinary deanery meetings called to discuss, among other things, the
danger of schism -- Fr. Petro Durkot, apparently an Old Ruthenian, complained
that the Basilians were publicly accusing local Old Ruthenian priests of tending
to schism. Wojewddzkie Archiwum Pañstwowe w Przeinylu (WAP-P),

607 At a meeting of the Liubachiv (Lubaczdw) deanery on 27 February 1912, at
which schismatic and Radical agitation were discussed, Fr. Severyn Metellia
introduced a resolution to the effect that schismatic agitation was caused not by
Orthodox agitators or priests, but by political relations: Polish church periodicals
like 'PrzeglQd Powszechny' and "Gazeta Kocielna" evinced a disdainful and
even hostile attitude towards the Greek-Catholic Church and clergy, which
caused the Ruthenian people to seek to protect their nationality from aggressive
polonisation, even to the extent of throwing themselves into the arms of schism.

"latinisation." 608 In general terms, the Russian orientation afforded
Ruthenians, both lay and clerical, at least a sense of power through
identification as a branch of the numerous and mighty Russian
nation. 609
According to an Austrian military source, in 1909 one-third of
the Ruthemans in Eastern Galicia were Russophile, two-thirds
Ukrainophile. 610 According to Cyrille Korolevskij, when Andrei
Sheptyts'kyi ascended to the metropolitan see of Halych in 1901, the
Russophiles, composed of clergy and intelligentsia, constituted a
third of the population of the Peremyshi' eparchy, nearly a third of
that of the L'viv eparchy, and less than a third in the Stanyslaviv
eparchy.61'
The Russophile movement naturally attracted the interest and
the generous financial support of imperial Russia. Scholarships
were provided for study in Russia, and student housing was
organised in various towns of Galicia. Pilgrimages were organised
to Kiev and to the monastery at Pochaiv (Pochaev), near the Galician
border. The Stauropegial Institute in L'viv became a Russophile
stronghold, and operated a major publishing house. The Ruthenian
National Home and the Galician Ruthenian Matitsa were the two
other major Russophile institutions.612
The growth of Russophile sympathies among the Greek-
Catholic clergy alarmed the Viennese authorities and led to the
resignation of Metropolitan losyf Sembratovych in 1882. In that year,
a reform and revitalisation of the Basilian order, the traditional
source of bishops, was undertaken by the Jesuits. In 1885 Syl'vester
Sembratovych was elevated to the metropolitan throne. In 1891 a

provincial synod was held in L'viv to settle questions of ritual and
discipline. The Julian (Old) Calendar was retained, as was the
custom of ordaining married men. 613 To some extent clerical
Russophilism was brought under control in Galicia, although
individual Old Ruthenian priests survived up to World War Two.614
In the Lemko region, an Orthodox movement continued well
into the twentieth century, with mass conversions from about 1911 to
1914. 615 Emigrants returning from the United States and Canada,
where the Russian Orthodox Church had made massive inroads
among the Ruthenian emigrant population, contributed to the
Orthodox movement in this region.
Something of the life of Old Ruthenian parish priests was
described in Chapters Four and Five. As was discussed in Chapter
Three, this was a dying class. Although Old Ruthenians remained
dominant in the metropolitan and episcopal consistories and
cathedral chapters at least until the first world war, there, too, their
influence waned. The socio-economic factors in the demise of the
priestly caste were mentioned in Chapter Three. Priests' sons
entered the free professions; priestly life became harsher; the war
ruined some families, the recession others. The advent of
compulsory priestly celibacy ended prospects of a continuation of the

614 Parish priest Fr. I. Hnatyshak, asked to present a talk on "How we
should utilise the Jubilee of the Baptism of Rus'-Ukraine in Pastoral Work" at
the Nyzhankovychi deanery meeting of 17 November 1938, did not appear at the
meeting because he did not recognise Ukraine. Undaunted, his dean, Fr. Ivan
Sendzik, requested the episcopal ordinariat in Peremyshi' to have him write a
paper on this theme and read it at the following meeting. WAP-P, ABGK file
5575, p. 80. Fr. Hnatyshak was evidently an Old Ruthanian. At a deanery
meeting in the Stanyslaviv eparchy in December 1938, Fr. Evhen Chubatyi, an
Old Ruthenian from Svarychiv, got into an argument with one Fr. Kostiuk, a
Ukrainian nationalist, regarding the latter's sermon on the 950th anniversary
of the Baptism of Rus'. Fr. Kostiuk ended with the assertion that Old Ruthenian
priests were dying out, while consciously Ukrainian priests were taking the
fore. Archiwum Akt Nowych (AAN), Ministerstwo Wyznan Religijnych i
Oswiecenia Publicznego (MWR i OP) file 384, p. 156. Although it seems unlikely
that there should have been any causal connection between residual Galician
Russophilism and the absorption of the Greek-Catholic Church into the Russian
Orthodox Church in 1945-1946, this topic deserves exploration.
615 For example, in 1912 it was reported that the entire village of Dolhe, part
of the Radotsyn parish, which was under an Old Ruthenian priest, had converted
to Orthodoxy. Orthodox tendencies were observed in other villages in the Lemko
region. Nvva 1912, 98-99.

priestly dynasties, and many potential priests presumably were
deterred from entering seminary.
There were other reasons, however, for the decline of the Old
Ruthenians. These were connected with the development of the
Russophile tendency itself after 1900, and with the events of World
War One.
Around the turn of the century the Old Ruthenians began to
lose ground to the "novokursnvk y ," a new generation of Russophiles
with a significantly different outlook. 616 The "novokursnvk y" took an
overtly political stance, identifying with the interests of the Russian
state.617 They were also more inclined to schism.
Thus, the Old Ruthenian movement, originally conceived as a
means of cultural-ecclesiastical self-preservation consistent with
both Catholicism and loyalty to the Habsburg empire, gave birth to a
series of apostasies on the one hand, and to a disloyal political
orientation on the other. Both these tendencies reached their
consummation during the Russian invasions of World War One.
The reaction of Polish society to these developments was
mixed. On the one hand, as mentioned in the Introduction, the
Polish clergy saw the Old Ruthenians as potential or even crypto-
schismatics. Some regarded their sympathies for Russia as proof
that their Catholicism was bogus. 618 This in turn provided a
rationale for converting the Ruthenians to the more "truly" Catholic
Latin rite. On the political side, some Polish nationalists recognised
Russophilism as an anti-Polish ideology, which sought the favour of
Poland's traditional enemy to the East. From 1900, however, the
newly emergent Polish National Democrats, a radically right-wing
nationalist movement headed by Roman Dmowski, tended to support
the Russophiles, as did the large landowners or "Podolians" of

617 Stefan Kieniewicz makes essentially the same distinction in pointing out

"Muscophiles," in his review article, "Rudnytsky's Essa y s in Modern
Ukrainian History in the Eyes of a Polish Historian." Harvard Ukrainian

Galicia, and a good part of the Latin-rite clergy. Politically, these
groups correctly saw the Russophile Old Ruthenians as a
conservative force opposed to both the Ukrainophile populists and the
socialist Radicals.619
From its beginnings the Russophile movement competed with
the populist and socialist tendencies. As John-Paul Himka has
shown, Rutheriian populism took a turn for the moderate in the late
1860s, due to clerical influence. This resulted from the need of the
urban populist intellectuals for a bridge to the masses in the
countryside. Such a role could only be played by the parish priests,
who had access to the peasants and who by founding reading-rooms
and teaching the people to read made it possible for the populists,
and later the Radicals, to reach them. In exchange for this service,
the clergy exerted a tempering influence on the populist movement.
In the late 1880s,however, Radical populism asserted itself as a
militantly anti-clerical socialist force.62°
Polish populism developed along similar lines in Galicia. The
"populist" or peasant movement led by Fr. Stojatowski in fact
exhibited anti-clerical tendencies as well as elements of socialism,
nationalism, and anti-Semitism. It was, however, not as socially
radical as its counterpart in the Russian partition, nor closely
comparable to nineteenth-century Russian populism. Polish
populism in Galicia generally represented the interests of landed
peasants. In inter-war Poland the "Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe"
would become an influential if ideologically amorphous party which
contributed men like Wincenty Witos and Stanislaw Mikolajczyk.621
In 1899, a number of Ruthenian right Radicals and populists
formed the National Democratic Party which in its various
subsequent incarnations became the dominant party in Ruthenian
and Ukrainian Galician politics for the next forty years. However,
the Radicals remained a force, with some eventually joining the
Communists and others forming the Ukrainian Socialist Radical
Party. The Social Democratic and Social Christian parties exerted
less influence. All of these, however, opposed the novokursnvkv, both

for their social conservatism and for their rejection of the Ukrainian
orientation.
Despite Polish support, the Russophiles began to lose their
political influence as suffrage was extended in Austria. The 1907
reform of the electoral system in Parliament enabled the populists to
gain at the expense of the Russophiles. After the assassination of
Viceroy Potocki by a Ukrainophile student in April 1908, his
successor Michal Bobrzyfiski discontinued the policy of supporting
the Russophiles, pursuing a more even-handed policy which allowed
the populists to assert themselves. In particular, he took steps which
culminated, with Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's cooperation, in the
electoral reform finally enacted under the next viceroy, Witold
Korytowski, in January 1914.622
It has been asserted that as Bishop of Stanyslaviv in 1899-1900,
Sheptyts'kyi favoured the Russophiles. 623 It appears that as
Metropolitan, he maintained a neutral stance. The Russophiles did
control the higher ecclesiastical posts in Galicia. The populists, on
the other hand, were hostile to Sheptyts'kyi despite his actions on
behalf of the Ruthenian cause. Furthermore, populism was still
associated with anti-clericalism, though by this time there were
many populist priests as well. The Metropolitan's condemnation of
the 1908 assassination of the Viceroy Potocki was resented by many
lay populists. 624 His order of 27 August 1908 forbidding priests to
interfere in each other's parishes was interpreted as being directed
against populist priests conducting activity in the parishes of their
Russophile neighbours. Nevertheless, a rapprochement between
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and the populists took place in the years
preceding the first world war.
At the same time, Orthodox agitation evidently prompted the
Metropolitan to warn against the dangers of schism in a pastoral
letter of 31 March 1910. 625 Bishop Khomyshyn did likewise in 1911.626

In early 1912, the Peremyshi' episcopal ordinariat requested all
deans to hold special meetings at which, among other things, the
Metropolitan's 1910 letter would be read, and parish priests would
report on any schismatic agitation in their parishes. 627 In July, 1912
the Metropolitan Ordinariat in L'viv ordered deans and parish
priests to try to prevent pilgrimages across the Russian border to
Pochaiv and to report any that were being planned; it also asked the
clergy to use the political authorities to weed out schismatic
agitators. The priests were reminded that they must teach the
faithful the difference between Catholicism and schism, and deans
were urged to arrange for missions in their deaneries. The matter of
schism was to be given foremost attention at deanery meetings.628
Russophilism thus came to be identified with schism, and
most of the Greek-Catholic clergy began to follow Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi's lead in abandoning it. Gradually, they adopted a
populist and then an outright nationalist orientation. 629 At the same
time, the need to preserve the Eastern tradition and to stave off
polonisation and latinisation -- a need which lay at the heart of the
Russophile movement -- came to be satisfied under Sheptyts'kyi's
guidance in a way that avoided absorption into Russian Orthodoxy.
This was the way of Church Union, which will be discussed below.630
In September 1914 the Russian army arrived in Galicia. The
rapidly retreating Austrians rounded up and hanged suspected
Russophiles, including priests. Several hundred Greek-Catholic
priests were deported to detention camps in Thalerhof,
those who oppose frequent communion and devotions to the Sacred Heart. It also
asserts that the Catholic faith, unlike that of the schismatics, is truly "Orthodox,"
and that the Union of 1596 was a voluntary reunion of the Ruthenians with the
One Church of Rome, which was the Church of St. Vladimir and various other
Eastern saints.

due to denunciations by Poles. 632 Russophiles allege that it was the

associates, who were responsible for the "Galician Golgotha."633
The Russian occupation of Galicia lasted several months
from the autumn of 1914 to the spring of 1915; Russian forces held
parts of Galicia into 1916, and made further gains as a result of the
Brusilov offensive in that year. During this time, the civil
administration treated the Ruthenian population fairly leniently.
However, Archbishop Evlogii of Voihynia attempted to carry through
a mass conversion of the Greek-Catholics to the Orthodox Church,
with the cooperation of the Russophiles. He sent Orthodox clergy to
take over parishes abandoned by Greek-Catholic priests who had fled
before the Russians or been arrested by the Austrians. In fact, the
Russian civil authorities were annoyed by his measures and sought
to restrain him. 634 In the event, a number of priests (perhaps 50) did

opposed Evlogii's "tactless agitation" for Orthodoxy. Dmytro Doroshenko, who
represented the Russian government in Galicia, relates that Bobrinskii
complained in a report that Evlogii had ignored his orders, appointing priests to
parishes where only a few people had requested one. By April 1915 Evlogii had
created 113 Orthodox parishes in Galicia, and during the next two months the

convert, along with all or part of various villages, particularly in the
border region of eastern Galicia. When the Russians retreated, a
number of priests and faithful who had converted to Orthodoxy fled
with them, fearing Austrian reprisals. 635 For others, however, the
Russian occupation brought disillusionment. The reality of the often
poorly educated Russian clergy, insensitive to Ruthenian traditions
and sensibilities, and speaking a language that sounded more
foreign than it appeared on paper, dispelled the Russophile
dream.636
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi himself was arrested by the Russian
authorities in September 1914 and deported to Russia, to be released
in 1917.637 By the time of his return to L'viv in 1918 he was hailed by
Galician Ukrainians as a national hero. On 21 February of that year,
he and Bishops Khomyshyn and Kotsylovs'kyi issued a joint pastoral
letter criticising the Russophile ideology and urging their priests to
number nearly doubled. After the Russian offensive of 1916, however, Evlogii
was not allowed to continue his campaign for the conversion of Galicia.
