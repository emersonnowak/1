situation of Church and people, combined with their greater activity
and zeal for self-improvement, pointed to a better future for the
national cause. A turning-point had been reached, he felt, and the
heralded reforms would find fertile ground. 162 Nevertheless,
Levyts'kyi was conscious of the low repute in which seminarians
were held:
It is an indisputable fact that every intelligent
Ruthenian person has a kind of strangely
reserved attitude towards the Ruthenian
theological seminary....
You'll meet some secular person -- an older
or younger person, or let's say a university
student -- and as soon as you start talking about
the seminary, you'll hear ridicule and jokes
about the laziness, shiftlessness, card-playing
and similar "virtues" of Ruthenian
seminarians. Nowadays any gymnasium pupil,
raised under the wing of the Ruthenian youth
leaders of L'viv, will give you a similar opinion
about the seminary.
A large portion of secondary school graduates
comes to the seminary with the same prejudice.
What's more, even among the accused, among
the seminarians themselves, you'll find those
who'll sing you the same song about the
seminary. 163

Levyts'kyi recognises that this poor public image is not
altogether unjustified, but considers it exaggerated:
I shall try to demonstrate that the Lviv
seminary is not a house of loafers and
freeloaders, that it is not a Galician Monaco, as
Hromads'kyi Holos wrote last year. But I do not
mean to say that our institution is ideal. This
would be the opposite extreme. There are quite a
few faults and lackings, their correction is
needed and necessary, and we probably won't
have to wait long for it. All the same time,
looking at matters as they now stand, taking all
the circumstances into account, we must draw a
conclusion that is far removed from what I
mentioned before.'64
Levyts'kyi feels that all the evils of the seminary can be traced
to the conditions in which the seminarians are forced to live. First
among these is overcrowding:
Where eight or nine people live at a single
"address," there can be no thought of serious
work. And it is difficult for the seminarians to be
housed so that people with like personalities
should end up together. If one wants to read,
another to write, and at the same time a third to
play the violin, a fourth to sing, a fifth to dance,
etc., what can be the result of all this? True, the
seminary has museums where one can study,
but each museum must accommodate, on the
average, 80 persons, and these are young, lively
persons. And this is the greatest cause of the
"shiftlessness" of the seminarians.
Whoever is determined and makes up his
mind will really prevail and will find the time
and room to work -- but not everyone, and not for
long. After a short while, each sleepless hour
and even the shortest time spent in some cold
corner will affect the health of such a
seminarian. To all this one must add the dust
and the unhealthful air in general, which in a
closeted and sedentary life affect one's health
most adversely. It is a fact that the greater part
of the seminarians belong in a hospital rather
than in a seminary. Stomach ailments,
headaches, anemia, all kinds of catarrh, which
plague a seminarian throughout his four years -
- this is the blessing of the seminary, this is the
164   Levytskyi 5.
63
incentive for intensive work! The same thing,
incidentally, happens n other seminaries as
well.165
In addition, the author mentions the lack of an adequate
library, the students' helplessness and impracticality, the absence of
educational guidance and leadership, and the low pay of the prefects,
who must seek outside work to supplement their incomes. Thus, he
concludes, seminarians cannot be judged by the same standards as
their more fortunate colleagues in secular institutions. Nevertheless,
Levyts'kyi feels that spiritual life in the seminary is not as benighted
as some may think. 166
Another seminarian, Osyp Ostashevs'kyi, writing in December
1913, relates that the students of 190 1-1902 were conscious of a need
for reform. He explains that Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, "following the
life of the seminarians, saw great lackings in their education, and
knew that such an education could not provide a clergy that would
correspond to the religious-cultural demands of its people and of the
present age." Furthermore, Ostashevs'kyi recounts that "our society
understood the importance of reform, for it knew that the
consequences of a reform would go beyond the walls of the seminary
and spread out in a beneficial stream amongst the entire people, and
therefore in 1901 our press spoke of it with joy." 167
Petro Mel'nychuk, not an eyewitness to pre-reform seminary
life but, as biographer of the post-reform rector (and subsequent
Bishop of Stanyslaviv) Rev. Hryhorii Khomyshyn presumably
familiar with relevant documents, relates that late nineteenth-
century students of the L'viv seminary were not particularly
dedicated to study, due to the lack of spiritual or academic leadership.
Aside from morning mass, lectures, and evening prayer, their time
was their own, and few were serious about theology. Some took
advantage of their access to secular university courses to become
teachers. But many spent their free time playing cards or going out
into the town and returning late. In the mornings, he relates, the
spiritual director would visit the rooms to make sure that all had

gone to liturgy. To evade his inspection, students would hide under
their beds; others would lurk in wardrobes and make startling
noises, sending him scurrying away muttering about the "unclean
powers" haunting the rooms. 168 While Mel'nychuk's description has
the ring of student lore and may have been affected by a desire to
underscore the importance of the reforms, it does convey something
of the superficiality widely thought to have characterised pre-reform
seminary life.
Thus, there was a general feeling in Galician Ruthenian
society at the turn of the century that the L'viv seminary was in need
of reform. However, judgments of the spiritual, academic and even
material level of seminary life necessarily depended on the frame of
reference. For example, in comparison with life in nineteenth-
century Russia's Orthodox seminaries -- a comparison that
Russophile clergy might have made -- the L'viv seminary might not
have appeared so deficient. 169 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's frame of
reference, and that of both the spiritual father at L'viv Rev. Isydor
Dol'nyts'kyi (educated at the Greek College in Rome) and the Rev.
Hryhorii Khomyshyn (educated in Vienna and rector at L'viv in 1902-
1904), was most likely the level of education prevailing in the central
and western European seminaries with which they all were
familiar. To the Russophiles, however, imitation of western
European and particularly Jesuit models would only augment the
already alarming degree of latinisation and polonisation in the
education of the Ruthenian clergy. 170 For at least some of the
seminarians and the lay public, the test of the quality of seminary
education was whether it could produce a clergy capable of
participating in the Ruthenian-Ukrainian national revival. Both
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's pastoral letter and Iaroslav Levyts'kyi's
comments also reveal a concern for the public image of the
seminarian and, ultimately, of the clergy itself. Those in favour of
reform realised that in order to eliminate the faults and abuses that
were grist for the Radicals' anti-clerical mill -- lazy, dissolute priests,
exorbitant sacramental fees, clerical obscurantism -- they would
have to start at the level of the seminary.

Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's reform of the L'viv seminary was
radical. It was completely re-organised, nearly all the personnel
were replaced, and the rules were simplified. A major role was
played by the Rev. Dol'nyts'kyi, who had already done much to settle
earlier liturgical controversies. 171 To improve spiritual life the
Basilian monks (who themselves had been reformed, by the Jesuits,
in 1882) were brought in to give retreats. 172
Was the reform successful? The best measure is the quality of
the priests that it ultimately produced. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's
biographer Cyrille Korolevskij, a French priest who adopted the
Byzantine rite (and a Slavic pseudonym), finds that "with the
progress made after the reform of the seminary, the metropolitan
possessed a respectable number of priests who had been very
correctly instructed and educated, and who were in no way inferior to
the best members of the Polish clergy." 173
4. Seminary Life
Under the prescriptions of the L'viv Ruthenian Provincial
Synod of 1891, priority in entrance to the seminary was to be given to
those who had shown signs of a priestly vocation. 174 Under the
reformed rules of the L'viv seminary, an entrant must have
completed secondary school and passed the matura examination.
With his application addressed to the metropolitan, he must submit,
besides his matura certificate, a certificate of baptism and
confirmation and evidence of irreproachable conduct and of good
health. An applicant requiring room and board must be prepared to
pay for them. Those applying from other eparchies must have their
bishop's consent. A satisfactory knowledge of Latin was required for
entrance to the Faculty of Philosophy of the L'viv seminary (as re-
organised in 1928 with Academy status), and in addition, Greek was
required for the Faculty of Theology. 175

seminarians (albeit in union with Rome) are being educated in a Polish and
Roman Catholic spirit.

Under Austria, the state funded seminary education and
strictly limited the number of places. 176 Under Poland, these matters
were covered by the 1925 Concordat with the Holy See. The number of
applicants was often high in relation to the number admitted. In
1921, out of 150 applicants to the expanded L'viv seminary (now
offering its own courses), only 56 were accepted. 177 An applicant who
entered ten years later recalls that "in those times, it was not easy to
get into this one Ukrainian higher school, for there were more
candidates than places in the Theological Seminary." He adds that
many entrants did not graduate; of the more than 200 admitted in the
winter of 1931, only 58 completed the L'viv Academy's five-year
course in 1936. 178
What, aside from a vocation, motivated young men to enter the
seminary? Whereas in the nineteenth century, Sons of priests studied
theology as a matter of course (see Chapter Four), the entry into this
former caste of young men of other social backgrounds in the
twentieth century, as discussed below, was often accompanied by an
idealistic motivation. In the changed social climate after the World
War, a priest's son readily could be expected to enter a secular
profession as readily as the priesthood. The choice of seminary was
no longer automatic, and required a strong vocation or other motives.
In 1923 Bohdan Nehrebets'kyi, a priest's son who had studied
medicine and taken part in the Austrian defence of Peremyshl',
where he was taken prisoner and sent to Siberia, applied to the
Peremyshl' seminary. Among the motives that he mentioned in his
application were a desire to help the suffering, for both humane and
religious reasons. He had thought deeply about the war and the
Russian revolution, he explained, and had sought the causes of
physical suffering and human bestiality. Men's minds had become
materialistic, and they ignored the commands of the Decalogue; thus,
there had been a decline in ethics and morals. The people's soul, he
felt, could only be healed by coming "back to Christ" -- and

67
Nehrebets'kyi had resolved to spread this slogan among the masses
as a priest. 179
There could be other reasons for a Ukrainian to wish to enter a
seminary in Polish-ruled Galicia. Ukrainians could enter Polish
universities only with the greatest difficulty. A numerus clausus was
imposed that excluded most Ukrainians unable to call on high
connections or pay bribes, or unwilling to change over to the Latin
rite (and thereby adopt Polish nationality). Few had the funds to
study abroad. For many, the seminary offered the only opportunity for
higher education (although the Vatican, possibly under pressure
from Polish circles, did not accord even the Academy the status of a
degree-granting university 180). This, writes one graduate of the
Greek-Catholic Academy, was the reason for the multitude of
"vocations" in the inter-war period. He adds that some may have
been motivated by purely material considerations. 181 Such motives
were probably more widespread in the 1930s Depression.
The social composition of Greek-Catholic seminarians
changed between the 1890s and the 1930s. In 1894, about half the
alumni at Peremyshi' -- 13 out of 25 -- were sons of priests. Five were
sons of peasants, three of townsmen. In 1900 and 1904, just under
one-third of the alumni (seven out of 24 and six out of 19, respectively)
came from priestly families; in 1900 peasants' sons already
outnumbered those of priests. Although the proportion of priests'
sons remained roughly the same (close th one-third) in 1914 and 1921,
peasants' or farmers' sons (the terminology in the records varies)
outnumbered them in those years and in 1922 through 1924, with the
proportion of clerics' sons falling to one out of seven, three out of 20
and six out of 35 at Peremyshi' in those latter three years. Among the
other seminarians at Peremyshi' between 1894 and1924 were sons of
townsmen, teachers, church cantors, judicial officials, smiths, and
workers or craftsmen. 182 A similar mix was to be found at L'viv,
where there were students not only from all of Galicia but also from

Eastern Ukraine, Volhynia, Bukovyna, Carpatho-Ukraine,
Yugoslavia, Germany, North America and elsewhere. 183 A 1936
graduate of the L'viv Academy recalls that priests' Sons constituted
only some ten percent of the students in his time, the rest being sons
of peasants, townsmen "and very rarely, of the intelligentsia." They
varied in age from 17 to 40. 184 Some seminarians were also war
veterans. Between 1920 and 1926, almost all the students of the L'viv
seminary had completed military service and had fought in the
world war or the Polish-Ukrainian war. 185
As suggested above, the spiritual life, physical conditions and
discipline in the seminary were all related. Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi's reforms announced in his pastoral letter of 1901 were
aimed at improving all three, along with the academic level. They
were incorporated in the revised statute of the L'viv theological
seminary (and later academy). These supplemented the decisions of
the 1891 Provincial Synod. 186
Spiritual life was naturally of prime importance. Seminarians
were expected to make weekly confession and daily examination of
conscience, to take frequent communion, to engage in spiritual
reading, pray frequently before the Blessed Sacrament and cultivate
especial reverence for the Blessed Virgin Mary. Besides participating
in all the services in the seminary chapel, they were to take part in
festive services in the cathedral of St. George, both on major religious
holidays and during Ukrainian national celebrations. 187
Seminarians must also be spiritually prepared for self-denial and
sacrifice. 188 They were to give alms insofar as possible. They were
encouraged to master practical subjects that could enable them to
serve their neighbour in the future. Each year, they must make an
eight-day retreat, with a special three or five-day retreat just before

ordination. A seminarian who did not take religious practices
seriously and zealously, instead performing them merely out of
obligation and exhibiting a worldly spirit, was to consider himself
lacking a vocation and must leave the seminary at once. Obedience,
brotherly love and solidarity were also to be cultivated. 189
The rules regulated discipline and physical conditions quite
explicitly. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's 1901 pastoral letter had
warned seminarians to avoid the influence of those who liked "cards,
debts and wine," 190 and accordingly, the revised rules forbade cards
or gambling, warned against debts, and prohibited alcohol in the
rooms, listing drunkenness among the grounds for expulsion. 191
Strolls outside the seminary walls were limited to two hours, and
must be undertaken in pairs; seminarians could not visit inns,
restaurants, cinemas, theatres or concert halls, or attend balls,
public festivities or meetings. 192 Smoking was allowed, but only in
the garden and in the students' rooms, and never between evening
prayers and breakfast. 193 Seminarians could not engage in editing or
contributing to periodicals without the rector's permission. 194 The
rules regulated hygiene, courtesy and manners, emphasising that
conversations must be carried on calmly, decently, and to the point,
"as befits a civilised person." 195 The framers of the rules apparently
were conscious of a need to improve the public image of the
seminarians (and presumably of the clergy as a whole), for they
exhorted them to avoid coarse language and behaviour in public, ill
befitting priestly dignity. In particular, loud talk or laughter,
shouting, looking about, loitering before shop-windows or staring at
passers-by, or waving one's arms about, were discouraged.' 96 Twice
a week during the academic year, seminarians were to take a two-
hour walk in groups of four comprising one student from each class,
under the direction of the eldest. 197
The rules encouraged seminarians to admonish each other in
case of infraction of the rules, and should this not be heeded, to

inform their superiors. 198 Obviously, this could be misunderstood as
inviting denunciations, which one unsympathetic source claims
were common. 199 However, in 1920 the dean, Rev. Tyt
Halushchyns'kyi, expelled a student who had informed on a
colleague, and at that time at least, denunciations were discouraged.
Halushchyns'kyi, who served as dean in 1920-1921 and again in 1924-
1925, reportedly had a mild manner of calling seminarians' attention
to their faults, which was very effective.200 Nevertheless, a certain
amount of surveillance over seminarians' activities was inevitable.
Rule 56, requiring students to post letters at a designated box and
never in town, seems to suggest that letters might be read by the
seminary authorities, which the hostile source referred to above
claims as having been the case. 201 Even a sympathetic observer like
Korolevskij finds, in commenting on the ratio of one prefect to fifteen
students, that discipline at L'viv was based on constant supervision
rather than on individual conscience. The supervision extended
beyond the seminary, for even during holidays at home, a
seminarian was under the supervision of his parish priest -- a less
liberal treatment than that accorded French or Belgian
seminarians, 202 though perhaps more so than that imposed on
Polish seminarians. 203
In the first years of the enlarged seminary of the 1920s, both
academic and spiritual life was in the hands of the Basilian monks
who, according to alumnus Nykolai Voiakovs'kyi, inculcated in the
students a love of the spiritual life and a spirit of self-sacrifice.
Indeed, he recalls that the material conditions at the L'viv seminary
provided an excellent opportunity to practise self-denial, for there
were food shortages and rationing. The constant lack of funds
prevented the administration from repairing broken windows, so
that one night, when the wind blew out the newspaper covering
Voiakovs'kyi's window, the snow fell in and his hair froze to the
pillow. In 1920-192 1 there was a shortage of fuel. For three months,
supper consisted of potatoes, bread, and tea with saccharine. When
conditions improved, luxuries like sugar and salt occasionally

became available. 204 Voiakovs'kyi also recalls the spiritual
"metamorphosis" effected by the Rev. Halushchyns'kyi's first
sermon during the yearly eight-day retreat, persuading the
seminarians that fulfilling the rule of absolute silence during the
entire eight days was not beyond their powers. 205 Indeed, physical
hardship may have promoted spiritual growth. In the 1930s, once or
twice a month between ten and fifteen students at a time would eat
only the soup course at meals, offering their second course to poor
students who could not afford to pay for meals in the refectory. 206
Both Voiakovs'kyi and Volodymyr Pelekh, who attended the
L'viv seminary about ten years after him (in 1931-1936), speak
warmly of student-faculty relations, noting that the seminarians
referred to their rector as "daddy." 207 In fact, such a filial
relationship was mandated by the rules. 208
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's reform and subsequent expansion
of the L'viv seminary affected academic life no less than spiritual life.
Yet change was slow in coming. In 1916, a priest had complained in
Nyva that the seminarians were being taught almost nothing of the
history of the Greek-Catholic church and rite, and did not even have
the chance to learn the Bible in the church language in which they
would celebrate mass as priests. Seminary graduates, having been
taught in Latin, did not know Ukrainian theological terminology,
while the only available book on the history of their church was in
German. 209 As long as the L'viv seminarians had to take their
courses at the University, this was likely to remain the case. In 1919,
however, courses were instituted at the seminary. By 1922 or 1923, the
students could study Church Slavonic, the history of the Greek-
Catholic Church, and Eastern dogmatics, and art history, as well as
novel subjects like "Causes of Atheism" and "The Social Question,"
both taught by the Rev. Havryil Kostel'nyk. The noted philologist and
Orthodox theologian Ivan Ohienko taught Ukrainian orthography,

exile from Soviet Ukraine, was brought in for a while to teach diction
and the art of lecturing; his declamations reportedly made a lasting
impression on the students. 210 When in 1928 the seminary became a
full-fledged five-year academy, obviating altogether the need for
students to attend lectures at the University, this programme was
expanded.
The founding of the Academy was not, however, an easy
matter. The government, suspecting nationalist aims, sought to block
the project. 211 In the meantime, the Rev. Tosyf Slipyi travelled to
western Europe to study theological education and examine the
statutes of higher theological institutions. He prepared a statute for
the L'viv academy, which was discussed by a three-man commission
and approved by the metropolitan on 22 February 1928. The Academy
was not officially opened until 6 October 1929, with Rev. losyf Slipyi as
rector. In his speech on that occasion, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi
outlined the new institution's aims, pointing out that they were
conditioned by his Church's special position as a mediator between
the Byzantine East and the Latin West. 212 He also observed that
whereas at the turn of the century, when materialism still prevailed,
theology was not considered a science, over the past thirty years this
attitude had changed. 213
The contemporary press generally saw the Academy as the
germ of either a Ukrainian university or a Catholic Oriental
university intended to educate priests who in turn could teach the
faith in a manner comprehensible to the peoples of the East. 214 In its
first three years (1928-1931), the Academy had around 150 to 190
students from the L'viv archeparchy and several from the
Peremyshi' eparchy; 116 completed their studies during this time. 215
These students followed a five-year course the that reflected the
metropolitan's concern with teaching both the Western and Eastern

response to the challenge presented by the Orthodox theological faculties in
Warsaw and Cernauti (Romania). Such a response was impossible at the
latinised and polonised theological faculty at the University of Lviv.

church tradition. The desiderata set forth in the pseudonymous
article of 1916 in Nyva cited above, 216 already embodied in the
seminary's programme of courses in the early 1920s, were expanded
upon. A lay church historian, Mykola Chubatyi, taught a pro-
seminar, a seminar in general church history, a two-semester
course on the Metropolitanate of Kiev and the Ukrainian-
Byelorussian Church, and a Ukrainian church history seminar for
the upper three years. Ivan Krypiakevych, another prominent lay
historian, taught general Ukrainian political history. The
metropolitan himself taught Eastern and Western ascetics. Three
courses and two seminars in Church Slavonic were taught along
with Greek and Hebrew. Volodymyr Zalozets'kyi taught Byzantine
and Ukrainian art history; another lay authority, Iaroslav Pasternak,
lectured on archaeology. Courses on anthropology and the history of
music were offered in addition to the more traditional subjects. 217
Academy training was not purely theoretical, for each fourth
and fifth-year student had to prepare and deliver one sermon. A
student who had mastered the required subjects could pursue other
interests that could be useful in his priestly work, and in general the
academy sought to introduce all seminarians to areas of knowledge
beyond the basic curriculum. 218
An academy required an ample library. Although a Soviet
source presumably having access to seminary records claims that
the library had only about 1,000 books, 219 an émigré work states that
there were over 12,000. 220 Students were expected to procure their
own textbooks, though they could not obtain other types of books or
subscribe to periodicals without the rector's permission. 221
Extra-curricular activities were a prominent feature of
seminary life both before and after the L'viv seminary reform and
subsequent expansion, and at Peremyshi' as well. The seminary
rules at L'viv allowed free time after dinner until two o'clock,
between 4:00 and 4:45, and then from supper until 8:30. Seminarians

could walk in the garden, converse, play chess, volley-ball or bowls, or
read. 222 One seminarian of the 1930s spent his free time learning
wood-carving and inlay work. 223 There was organised group activity
as well. A musical club had a chorus and orchestra, and staged
comic reviews satirising prefects, faculty and even the rector. 224
Probably the oldest group at L'viv was the Brotherhood of the
Presentation of the Virgin, founded by the Rev. Isydor Dol'nyts'kyi in
1885 and still active in the 1930s, which enjoyed special indulgences
as well as its own chapel. 225 A Marian Sodality was organised in
1913 as a section of this brotherhood. 226 The "Reading-room" Society,
founded in 1849, possessed a library of 1,132 volumes in 1898, the
largest category of which was Ruthenian and Russian belles-lettres.
227 After a period of apathy, the "Reading-room of Ruthenian-
Ukrainian Seminarians" was revived in 1902. About the same time,
Russophile students formed a "Circle of Russian Students of the
Faculty of Theology," which organised an evening programme in
honour of Pushkin but was soon closed down by the administration
for its overtly pro-Russian views. A quarterly journal called
Katolytskyi Vskhid ("The Catholic East") was founded. The Slavic
Circle, which had foundered in the pre-reform years, was revived
and became particularly active in1905. Its members corresponded
with seminarians in Transcarpathia, Bukovyna, and Russian
Ukraine, and even hosted a delegation of Transcarpathian
Ruthenians. Among their aims was to raise the national
consciousness of these groups. The Slavic Circle also maintained
contacts with Czech and Slovenian seminarians. 228
In order to increase their contacts with the popular masses,
the L'viv seminarians organised an "Enlightenment Committee" in
1908, which sent its members to give talks at reading-rooms in the
area. This committee became the "Enlightenment Circle," and
around 1908-1909, with the decline of the Slavic Circle and the journal
Katolytskui Vsk hid, it became a focus of extra-curricular activity. In
their expeditions to the countryslde the seminarians came up

against the anti-clerical efforts of secular enlighteners, but also
gained the approval of the Prosvit p ('Enlightenment") organisation
and at least some of the press. 229 They set up reading-rooms and
agricultural societies -- good preparation for their future social
activism as parish priests. They also worked with neglected children,
and prided themselves on preserving them from Polish influences.
230
Although a Theological Circle was still functioning in 1913,
other groups, like the temperance and literary societies, languished
in the first decade and a half after the seminary reform. 231 The
Theological Circle was re-organised as the "Theological Scholarly
Society of Ukrainian Seminarians in L'viv," and published an
almanac in 1914. 232 Around this time the temperance and literary
circles were revived, and a sports club was begun. After student
participation in the Vienna Eucharistic Congress in September 1912,
there was a rebirth of spiritual life, and the Markiian Shashkevych
memorial reading room was founded. Its members arranged
subscriptions to German and Polish theological journals and gave
charity benefit concerts. 233
The Brotherhood of the Presentation, the Enlightenment
Reading-room and a number of cooperative, temperance, and other
circles within the seminary gave the students a taste of the
Ukrainian organisational life in which they would be expected to
participate as priests. 234 In one form or another, these groups
continued at L'viv after the first world war. In addition, the seminary
chorus became well known throughout Galicia, and in the 1930s it
toured the province. Its audiences occasionally included noted
composers such as Liudkevych and Barvins'kyi. 235 Organising the
seminary orchestra was more difficult, however; instruments which
had been used by the Sich Sharpshooters in the war had to be
borrowed from the Lysenko Musical Institute. 236

Jubilees were an important feature of Ruthenian and
Ukrainian culture, and the Lviv seminarians organised or
participated in a number of celebrations of events deemed significant
by Church and society. Among these were the centennial of the birth
of the Rev. Markiian Shashkevych, a writer, member of
the"Ruthenian Triad" and popular enlightener, in 1911; the lGOOth
anniversary of the Edict of Milan and the 300th of the death of
Metropolitan Ipatii Potii, an initiator of the Union of Brest, in 1913;
and, in 1937, the 300th anniversary of the death of Metropolitan losyf
Veliamyn Ruts'kyi, an advocate of Uniate-Orthodox union, and the
centenary of the publication of Rusalka Dnistrova, a collection of
Ruthenian folklore among the publishers of which was the Rev.
Shashkevych. 237
At the Peremyshl' seminary, extra-curricular activity was less
developed. The absence of any organisations at that seminary until
the appearance of the "Scholarly Circle" in 1922 may be explained by
the fact that this had not been a full four-year seminary until the
preceding year, and that fourth-year students generally had the least
amount of free time; furthermore, as long as there was only a fourth-
year class there, the next class to arrive each year would have lost
touch with its predecessor due to their physical separation, virtually
foreclosing continuity in the work of any student organisations. 238
The members of the "Scholarly Circle" pursued theology,
contemporary literature, and the propagation of the Ukrainian
language. In the year of its founding, the Circle had a library of 25
books, and presented seven lectures, mostly on practical subjects. In
the following year, about 100 books were acquired. Subscriptions were
opened to several secular and theological journals. Work began on
an almanac, which was published on the 300th anniversary of the
death of St. Josaphat Kuntsevych (considered the chief Ruthenian
Uniate martyr), in 1923. In 1923-1924 the Scholarly Circle organised
lectures on such diverse subjects as medicine, icons, and charitable
work in the villages. Later lectures concerned topics ranging from
autocephaly to bee-keeping. About this time a museum was also set
up, on the initiative of the rector, the future bishop Rev. Hryhorii

Lakota. In the latter half of the 1920s, however, the society declined,
because of the lack of seminarians in the wake of the introduction of
compulsory priestly celibacy in 1925 (see below, and Chapter Four,
Section 1). In 1927-1928 the society gave no lectures, but spent 29 zloty
on books, and donated 10 zloty to the Prosvita society and five zloty for
political prisoners. After this, there began a period of renewal of the
Scholarly Circle. 239 The group was still active in 1937. 240 A
cooperative of theology students seems to have existed at Peremyshi'
too, and in 1937 the seminarians published another almanac. 241
The academic level at Peremyshi' is described by several of its
graduates who attended in the l930s as good or satisfactory. 242 One
graduate complains, however, that church history was taught
separately from the history of the people, and that altogether there
was too little patriotic education, with a lack of jubilee celebrations
and special lectures. He also criticises the absence of foreign
anguages in the curriculum, and the superficial treatment of canon
law. Finally, he feels that there was too little practical education --
though another graduate says the opposite. 243 Another finds the
level high, and recalls that the programme was demanding. 244
Two Peremyshi' graduates of the 1930s recall that discipline
was harsh; one of them characterises this as a Latin-style
innovation. He states that seminary life was based on the monastic
system, with seminarians sleeping in ten- to twelve-bed dormitories
in the first two years and rising at 5:30. Holidays were limited to two
months in the summer. Generally, discipline as described by this
individual resembles that prevailing in L'viv. 245 The other graduate
recalls that the seminary administration showed a lack of trust in
the students, relying instead on harsh methods and constant
surveillance. There was a lack of recreational activities. He also
observes that during the summer holidays, the seminarians were
given too little to do by their parish priests, their duties usually being

limited to serving at the liturgy; Polish priests, by contrast, were
more demanding in this respect. 246
There is little information available about the Stanyslaviv
seminary. Hostile accounts focus on the controversy surrounding the
introduction of compulsory priestly celibacy in that eparchy in 1920,
and even a most sympathetic biography of Bishop Khomyshyn of
Stanyslaviv, whose long tenure (1904-1945) saw the establishment of
his diocesan seminary in 1907, limits the discussion of priestly
education almost entirely to the celibacy issue. 247 (This issue will be
discussed below and in Chapters Four and Seven.) Several memoirs,
however, provide a fragmentary picture of life in the Stanyslaviv
seminary. 248
Like their precedessors. the over 30 students accepted in the
first year in 1906 were sent to the L'viv seminary from the Stanyslaviv
eparchy to take courses at the University, but after the Christmas
holidays became the first entering class at the new Stanyslaviv
seminary. Their rector was a Basilian monk, Rev. Ieremiia
Lomnyts'kyi. 249 By 1922-1924, the number of seminarians at
Stanyslaviv was 140.250
As in the L'viv seminary, young men entered the seminary at
Stanyslaviv for a number of reasons besides some sense of vocation.
The Rev. Petro Mel'nychuk, ordained in 1928, began his university
studies at the secret Ukrainian university in L'viv in1922. GIven the
uncertain conditions of the times he and a few friends decided to
study theology at Stanyslaviv, since admission to the other Greek-
Catholic seminaries was closed. Although Bishop Khomyshyn
seemed displeased that the youths were applying to his seminary in
the middle of the academic year and only as a last resort, he accepted
them. 251
In the first years after World War I, material conditions were
about as dlfficult in Stanyslaviv as at L'viv and Peremyshi'.
Mel'nychuk mentions that many of the students were war veterans
who were poor and lacked appropriate clothing. Students received no

money from the state. The seminary food was insufficient, the rooms
were cold, and there was a lack of fuel. 252 In addition, seminary life
was intentionally hard. A seminarian of 1923-1925 who left over the
celibacy issue recalls that the rigorous discipline helped to build
spiritual life. Upon being awakened by the bell in the morning,
seminarians had to maintain silence in the halls on their way to the
chapel, where they would spend an hour on their knees in meditation
on the subjects presented to them by the spiritual father on the
previous evening. Next came a liturgy, and it was only after another
ten minutes of thanksgiving in the chapel that the students could
proceed to the refectory for a rather modest breakfast and the day's
first opportunity to converse. After lectures and dinner there was
time for chess, billiards, discussions, jokes and anecdotes, followed by
a one-hour walk beyond the town limits. There followed more
lectures, study time, supper, and the presentation of topics for the
next morning's meditation. 253
Under the rectorship of the Rev. Lomnyts'kyi, Bishop
Khomyshyn, who as rector at L'viv in 1902-1904 was familiar with
Sheptyts'kyi s reform, assembled a distinguished faculty including
the Basilian Tyt Halushchyns'kyi, the Basilian and future bishop of
Peremyshl' losafat Kotsylovs'kyi, the future bishops Ivan
Liatyshevs'kyi and Nykolai Charnets'kyi, and the Rev. Iakiv
Medvets'kyi, future Apostolic Administrator for the Lemko region.
Bishop Khomyshyn paid close attention to the seminary and
students, all of whom he knew personally, and frequently attended
their leisure activities to converse with them. 254 Considered by the
Rev. Mel'nychuk to have been both demanding and dedicated, Bishop
Khomyshyn lectured at the seminary every evening. 255
