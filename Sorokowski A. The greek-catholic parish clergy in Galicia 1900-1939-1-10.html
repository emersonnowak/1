Politicians and military strategists were well aware of its importance

as a bulwark against Russia. Peremyshl' (Przemygl) was one of the

most heavily fortified towns of Europe, and its successive sieges by

Russians and Austrians were major events in the first world war.

Perhaps even more keenly felt, however, was the danger of Russian

influence among a population that, in Eastern Galicia, mostly spoke

an East Slavic language and belonged to a Church which, while

Catholic, bore close resemblance to Orthodoxy. The conversion of a

few Galician priests and villages to Orthodoxy caused concern in

Vienna, which seemed justified by the mass conversions during the

Russian occupation in World War I. In the first decade and a half of

the twentieth century, the politicisation of Galician Russophilism,

which had begun as a purely cultural orientation, provoked alarm in

Vienna which culminated in treason trials and indiscriminate

hangings during the first years of the war.

At the same time, the fact that the Galician population was

ethnically related to, and in some opinions a part of, the renascent

Ukrainian nation to the east took on increasing importance in the

final decades of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the

twentieth. The arrival of political exiles from the Ukraine reinforced

the Ruthenian intelligentsia's sense of being one people with the

Ukrainians, and this sense filtered down gradually to the peasants,

largely through the mediation of the Greek-Catholic parish clergy.

Austrian statesmen were quick to see the significance of this

alternative to the Russophile orientation. Ukrainian separatism

provided a wedge into Russia, and the Ukrainian orientation in

Galicia gave Austria one more weapon against her neighbour to the

northeast.

Ukrainian dreams of autonomy or independence paralleled,

and in fact were often inspired by, similar aspirations among the

Poles. The unexpected crumbling of both the Austro-Hungarian and

the Russian empires in the last two years of the world war left Poles

and Ukrainians free to dispute the territories inhabited by both. A

Polish-Ukrainian war over Eastern Galicia immediately ensued,

lasting from November 1918 to July 1919 and ending in defeat for the

Ukrainian Galician Army.

In the meantime the Eastern Ukrainians had set up an

independent Republic in the wake of the 1917 Russian revolution


which declared its independence on 22 January 1918, a few days

before the arrival of Bolshevik forces in Kiev. Embattled by Reds and

Whites, with no help from the Russian-oriented Allies, the

Ukrainian Popular Republic found temporary support from the

Germans after Brest-Litovsk, though at the cost of a burdensome

occupation and undue political interference. The conservative regime

of Hetman Skoropadsky crumbled along with the Central Powers

that had supported him. As their Galician brethren were setting up

the Western Ukrainian Popular Republic and battling the Poles, the

Eastern Ukrainians organised a Directory, whose armies sought to

stave off Bolsheviks, Whites, anarchists, and typhus. Finally Symon

Petliura obtained help from J6zef Pitsudski, though at the cost of

Galicia. The Polish-Ukrainian expedition of May 1920 took Kiev, but

the ensuing Bolshevik counter-attack dispelled the Ukrainian forces

and pushed the Poles back to Warsaw by August. With the "miracle

of the Vistula" Pilsudski was able to drive back the Bolsheviks and

ultimately to carve out a Polish state with ample eastern borders

including a large non-Polish population. Among them were the

former troops of the Ukrainian Galician Army and Petliura's forces.

The vast eastern borderlands proved a liability as well as a buffer for

Poland, for ethnic problems plagued the Polish Republic throughout

the two decades of its existence. Nowhere was this more evident than

in Galicia.

In the inter-war period Eastern Galicia became for Poland

what it had been for Austria: a buffer against Russia populated by an

element of uncertain political loyalty. Both the Soviet Union and

Germany played upon the grievances of the Ukrainian minority,

extending their influence into subversive organisations. Successive

Polish regimes tried different policies to shore up this important

bulwark, settling ethnically Polish colonists, organising special

border detachments, "pacifying" the population through police and

military action. Ultimately, however, the political orientation of the

Ukrainians of Galicia developed in such a manner as to preclude its

tranquil inclusion in anything other than a Ukrainian state. The

acceptance of this political orientation by the clergy was an important

element in this situation.

The focus of this study is the transformation of the ideas,

attitudes, and world-view of the Greek-Catholic clergy in Galicia.


How did their sense of national identity and their political allegiance

change? How did their cultural orientation, both sacred and secular,

develop? What did they feel to be their role in Ruthenian or Ukrainian

society, and in the broader context of European Christendom?

Although given the current state of research it is impossible to

answer these questions definitively, an attempt will be made to

provide tentative answers which may point the way to more fruitful

research.

The evolution of the mentality of the Greek-Catholic parish

clergy in Galicia has parallels in other times and places. Their

closest neighbours, the Polish Latin-rite clerics, appear to have

undergone changes during the same period which have yet to be

examined in a systematic manner. The socio-economic and

sometimes political activism of Polish priests, particularly in the

Prussian partition, are known. Fr. Stojatowski

1 and, later, Fr.

Pana s2 were prominent political figures. Many Polish clerics

supported the nationalistic Narodowa Demokracja

(Endeky) of

Roman Dmowski.3 Like the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic priests, Polish

Latin-rite priests sometimes ran afoul of the state authorities

because of their political activities. In fact, a Polish government

memorandum of March 1938 complains of the subversive anti-state

propaganda carried on by clerics engaged in politics.4 But whereas

the political activity of the Polish clergy in the Polish state lacked the

national ingredient that so fired the Ukrainian clergy of the time, the

role of Polish priests in Partition Poland resembled that of the

Ukrainian clergy more closely.

Religion and nationality have proved a potent mix in many

contexts, and clerics have appeared as the natural leaders of national

movements reinforced by confessional divisions.5 This was the case

with Greek-Catholic communities in lands adjacent to Galicia --

Hungary, Romania and Slovakia -- as well as further abroad. In the

Kingdom of Hungary, both Romanian and Ruthenian Greek-

Catholics sought to stave off latinisation which, as in Galicia, was

perceived as a means of ethnic assimilation with the dominant

nationality.6 In Transylvania, however, Orthodoxy had served to

preserve Romanian ethnic identity during Turkish rule, and the fact

that the subsequent Austrian government favoured the Uniates who

had joined with Rome in 1701 put the latter at odds with Romanian

nationalism.? In the lands of Transcarpathia and the Pregov

(Eperjes) region, which passed from Hungary to Czechoslovakia after

World War I, the Greek-Catholic Church helped to protect the

Ruthenians from assimilation with the Slovaks.8

Uniate Churches have also flourished in the Middle East and

India, though not as bulwarks of separate nationality. They are

grouped in churches descended from the Assyrian Church of the

East (the Chaldean and Malabar Churches), from Oriental Orthodox

Churches, and from the Byzantine-rite Orthodox Church

(the

Melkite Church).9 The Armenian Uniates who established

themselves in Poland, whither they had come as merchants, were in

fact centered in L'viv

(Lwow). Although they became thoroughly

polonised, they maintained a strong ecclesiastical identity, and

In the Low Countries, Catholicism became a basis for a

national division when Belgium (the name was taken from a tribe

that existed in Roman times) was created in 1830. However, Brabant

and Limburg have retained significant Protestant Flemish

minorities. At the same time, a sizeable Catholic minority has

remained in Friesland in the Netherlands.11 In these areas

religious, ethnic and linguistic divisions do not fully coincide.

It has also happened that the ethnic factor has sparked a new

confessional division. This occurred among Catholic East European

immigrants in the United States, where in the nineteenth century

the Church was heavily Irish. Complaining of polonisation in

Chicago, Lithuanians formed their own national church was

formed in that city in

1906. Disputes over ownership of church

property and appointment of pastors had combined with ethnic

friction to prompt the formation of a Polish Catholic Church. Their

Bishop, Anton Kozlowski, received his orders from the Old Catholic

Church, a European schism that had arisen in the wake of the First

Vatican Council. In 1898 a Polish Independent Catholic Church was

formed in Buffalo, New York under Bishop Stefan Kaminski. By 1907

both these Churches had become affiliated with the Polish National

Catholic Church established in

1900 and based in Scranton,

Pennsylvania, under Bishop Francis Hodur. This Church even

established a mission in Poland.12

The transformation of the Greek-Catholic parish clergy in

Galicia between 1900 and 1939 can thus be seen in the context of the

interplay of religious and national currents in modernising societies.
