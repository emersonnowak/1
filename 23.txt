1. Bvzantinists and Westernisers
Although the 1891 L'viv Provincial Synod settled much of the ritual
controversy of the preceding decades, the broader controversy over
church culture continued right up to 1939 (and, in fact, beyond). With
the waning of Russophilism and the gradual adoption by the Greek-
Catholic clergy of a "Ukrainian Catholic" national, religious and
political identity, the focus of the debate shifted from narrow ritual
disputes to the deeper question of the Church's cultural identity, and
in particular the cultural identity of the clergy. To say that this
identity could only be Ukrainian begs the question, for it was not
altogether clear what Ukrainian cultural identity should mean for
Galicians, and specifically for Galician priests. Between 1900 and
1939, two prime cultural orientations developed within the Greek-
Catholic Church. Insofar as the parish clergy were concerned with
such questions, they remained divided between these orientations,
though not in equal portions.
The leaders of the Greek-Catholic Church were conscious of
their position on the border between the Eastern and Western
European cultural spheres 691 This consciousness was transmitted
to the rank-and-file clergy in the seminary and beyond. 692 The
consciousness that their position was unique reinforced the
conviction of some Greek-Catholic priests that they had been chosen
to fulfill a special historical mission.693
As discussed above (Chapter Six, Section 1), the Old Ruthenian
clergy sought their cultural identity in a Russian orientation. This
691     In 1906 "Brat Virnyi" wrote of the Ruthenian-Catholic Church's
"providential role," poised as it was "on the border of two world Christian
cultures," of harmonising these two cultures in the name of one holy, Catholic
and apostolic Church. Brat Virnyi.        j ruskyi klyr? L'viv, 1906.
692 Speaking at the official inauguration of the L'viv Theological Academy
on 6 October 1929, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi referred to "the situation of our land
and our Church on the borderland of the western and eastern worlds." "This
situation," he continued, "imposes on us the role of a mediator between East and
West." These two cultures were united "in our land, in our institutions and in
our souls." Quoted in Marusyn, Myroslav. "Pohliad na vykhovannia
kandydativ dukhovnoho stanu na Ukraini," Bohosloviia 49-50. The Metropolitan
also called for a re-evaluation of the Union, asking whether it should not be
pursued on an altogether different basis in the future. Hreko-katolvts'ka

primarily took the form of a movement to purge the Greek-Catholic
rite of latinisms and to restore East Slavic traits in ritual. As the
Russophile tendencies of the Old Ruthenians waned, the impulse to
preserve the Byzantine rite nevertheless persisted, and gradually
passed into the hands of the Byzantinists.
One of the two principal cultural movements among the
Greek-Catholic clergy in the twentieth century, the Byzantine
tendency combined with a clearly Ukrainian national political and
cultural orientation. No longer looking to Russia for a model, the
Byzantinists sought to revive Ukrainian ecclesiastical traditions. To
some, however, Byzantinism was as objectionable as had been
Russophilism, and for similar reasons. This was the view of Polish
clerics who tended to equate the Latin rite with Catholicism and the
Byzantine rite with the Orthodox schism. Thus, in 1926 Rev.
Mieczystaw Tarnawski, who was hardly hostile to the Greek-
Catholics, counted Byzantinism among the three principal enemies
of the Uniate Church. Whereas he felt that the Greek-Catholic clergy
were well aware of the "external" dangers of Protestantism and
Ukrainian Orthodox autocephaly, he found them insufficiently
conscious of the "internal" danger of Byzantinism. 694 Among the
manifestations of the movement for purification of the Greek-
Catholic rite was the attempt to prepare new editions of service books
(trebnyky), missals, prayer books, and other liturgical books in accord
with Byzantine tradition. This project appears to have passed
smoothly from the hands of the Old Ruthenians into those of the
Ukrainian Byzantinists. The conflicts arose, rather, between the
Byzantinists and the Westernisers. Successive liturgical
commissions had only limited success. The Bishops of Peremyshi'
and Stanyslaviv could not come to an agreement with the L'viv
Archeparchy in this matter, and finally in 1938, a Vatican
commission under Cardinal Tisserant took over the project. It was
successful, following the moderate Byzantinist line of Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi, and produced a series of new editions, though not until
the 1940s and 1950s.695

212
In competition with the Byzantinists, the Westernisers were
led by Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn, whose opinions on priestly
celibacy and politics have already been mentioned. Educated at
Vienna, Bishop Khomyshyn sought to introduce Latin- rite
pastoral methods, customs and to some extent discipline and
spirituality into the Greek-Catholic Church. However, he felt that
such "importations" from the Latin rite must be fully assimilated by
the Church, and even "Ukrainianised." In his 1931 pastoral letter on
Byzantinism, he asserted that this had in fact already occurred with
many Latin practices.696
Bishop Khomyshyn had introduced a number of westernising
changes in his eparchy on 15 February 1916, in the wake of the first
Russian occupation of Galicia (and while Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi
was in exile in Russia). In his pastoral letter of that date "On the
Mission of the Ukrainian People in the Catholic Church," he had
ordered that the word "pravoslavn y i" should be replaced in the
liturgy with the word "pravovirnvi." a neologism denoting the
original sense of "right-worshipping" Christians and which could
not be misunderstood (as the former word apparently often was) to
refer to the schismatics. He had also ordered, among other things,
that the word "tsar," which could be mistakenly understood to refer
to the Russian Tsar, should be replaced with "imperator" in prayers,
that prayers for the Pope of Rome should be added, that the
Gregorian calendar should be introduced on 25 March, and that the
cult of the Eucharist should be observed. Not all the changes
mandated by this letter were westernisations; thus, it ordered
celebration of the day of St. Josaphat, principal martyr for the
Union. 697 After Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi returned from exile in

Among the practices thus assimilated were the eucharistic cult (including the

of rosaries. Id. 19-20.

calendar remained in force.698
Bishop losafat Kotsylovs'kyi of Peremyshi' took a more
radically Ukrainian political line than Bishop Khomyshyn. He also
shared Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's enthusiasm for the Union, and
his choice of the name of the great martyr for church unity as his
monastic appellation seems to have been significant in this regard.
Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi favoured a Union that, unlike the Union of
Brest, would begin with the peasants and workers and work up
through society to the bishops, rather than the other way round.699
However, he also favoured the introduction of certain Western
customs in the Greek-Catholic Church. Like his fellow hierarch in
Stanyslaviv, he sought to remove the term "pravoslavnvi" from the
liturgy and replace it with "pravovirnvi." 70 ° Bishop Khomyshyn
reasoned that the new phrase would remove the confusion of many
believers as to whether they were Catholic or Orthodox, and would
prevent further conversions to the Orthodox church. However, the
notoriously conservative Lemkos in the western part of the
Peremyshi' eparchy were scandalised by such an innovation. By
some accounts, this only aided the proponents of Orthodoxy, who
warned that the change was a harbinger of latinisation and
conversion to the Latin rite. In fact, in 1927-1928 schism did break out
in Tyliava, Koroleva Rus'ka and elsewhere in the Lemko region.70'

Gregorian calendar in the Greek-Catholic Church originated in Austrian

Ukrainian lay circles that the matter could not be decided without a provincial

"Dravoslavnykh khrvstiian" be simply removed. Id., no. 9,1928,139-142.
701 At the Mushyna deanery meeting of 31 May 1927, Dean Volodymyr
Mokhnats'kyi led a discussion of the apostasy of Koroleva Rus'ka, in which he
cited various factors but did emphasise the importance to the Lemkos of the word
"pravoslavnyi" in the liturgy. Rev. R. Pryslops'kyi favoured reinstating this
214
By one account, the elimination of the word "pravoslavnvkh" was the
first hint to some Lemko villagers that they were not in fact Orthodox,
but Uniates. Apparently, in their minds the Union had been imposed
on them without their knowledge or consent, and only some two
centuries later was the fact revealed. In some cases, this precipitated
transfers to Orthodoxy.702
The Lemko case has been used to argue that the use of the
word "pravoslavnyi" stimulated apostasy -- on the ground that
conversions to Orthodoxy took place before the word's abolition -- as
well as that use of this word could have prevented it -- on the ground
that conversions took place after its abolition. In fact, neither theory
is convincing. However, this controversy illustrates the significance
attached to questions of ritual and terminology by the Greek-Catholic
clergy.
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's version of Byzantinism was not a
wholesale rejection of western forms. In a joint pastoral letter of 6
(19) April 1909 addressed to the clergy of the three eparchies, he and
Bishops Khomyshyn and Chekhovych recalled that when in June
1899 the Pope and all Catholic bishops had dedicated the world to the
Sacred Heart of Jesus, some Greek-Catholic priests had objected to
this as an alien form of piety. The bishops stressed that this was a
matter that went beyond rite, devotion to the Sacred Heart being
common to all rites rather than the monopoly of one. They also noted
that the people must be taught to look beyond rite to matters of faith
and morals, so that they might distinguish between Byzantine-rite
Catholicism and Byzantine-rite Orthodoxy. The letter ordered the
parish clergy to hold the appropriate solemn ceremony on the first
Sunday after the 11th of June, having explained the significance of
the cult of the Sacred Heart to their parishioners on the previous
word in the liturgy, while Rev. Ivan Kachmar, parish priest at Zlots'ke,
suggested reintroducing it only where absolutely necessary to avoid a greater
evil. Rev. Kachmar's proposition was approved unanimously. WAP-P, ABGK

Sunday. 703 Furthermore, by the late 1930s Latin-style devotions had
become popular in Galicia. Among them were the Way of the Cross,
devotions to the Virgin Mary on the first Friday of the month and in
May, and the use of rosaries. The feast day of Christ the King was
also introduced into the Greek-Catholic Church. 704 Bishop
Khomyshyn asserted in 1931 that the rosary was generally practiced
by both priests and faithful, and that use of scapulars had been
accepted.705
At the same time, their acceptance of a Ukrainian national
identity placed the Greek-Catholic parish clergy in the awkward
positon of being the beneficiaries of an Eastern cultural heritage
closely bound up with a distinctly Orthodox and indeed anti-Uniate
religious orientation. The works of Taras Shevchenko, the founder
and chief exponent of the Ukrainian national revival of the
nineteenth century, contained passages highly critical of the Catholic
Church and the Union. If the Greek-Catholic parish clergy were to
continue to take part in nation-building, they had to somehow come to
terms with this part of the Ukrainian heritage. They would have to
purge it of its anti-Uniate elements, explain them, or simply ignore
them. Ultimately, the Byzantine tradition had to be redefined in such
a way as to show that its anti-Uniate elements were in fact politically
motivated Muscovite accretions, while its essential elements had
been and remained consistent with Catholicism, albeit broadly
defined.
As mentioned above, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi was able to
eliminate the phenomenon of Russophilism in part by replacing it
with a renewed ideology of Union. This acted both as a functional
equivalent of Russophilism, preserving the Eastern rite, and as a
harmonising factor between the Byzantine tradition and
Catholicism. It made it possible to assimilate the Orthodox tradition
or at least come closer to it, though of course eliminating its anti-
Uniate and anti-Roman elements. To the extent that anti-Uniatism

could be explained by political factors, such as the role of the
Muscovite and Russian Church in supporting state expansion, it
could be excised from the Eastern tradition, leaving intact those
elements more easily reconciled with Catholicism.
The Eastern tradition also had to be purged of its Russian
national colouring. At the same time it was necessary to rediscover a
specifically Ukrainian Byzantine tradition. It had to be shown that
the Greek-Catholic Church had roots that were venerable, Byzantine,
Catholic and Ukrainian. This appears to have been done. By 1939, a
parish priest could refer to the Greek-Catholic rite as being truly
"Ukrainian-Catholic."706
However, to achieve credibility and attractiveness to the
Orthodox, a Church bent on spreading the Union had to demonstrate
that its own Union with the Holy See had succeeded in preserving the
Byzantine rite. Obviously, a modern and truly ecumenical Uniatism
mandated Byzantinism. In his farewell editorial in Nyva in October
1929, Rev. Havryil Kostel'nyk, the prime representative of the
Byzantinist orientation, stressed that Greek-Catholics must not
alienate the Orthodox. The history and the mission of the Greek-
Catholic Church was in the East, and as long as it remained a
neutrum, half-way between East and West, it could not realise its
destiny. He also made the point that whereas in his native
Yugoslavia, where Galician emigrants had preserved the Byzantine
rite in its original form, Greek-Catholicism remained strong,
emigrants from Galicia, where the Church had been latinised, were
going over to Orthodoxy en masse. 707 Rev. Kostel'nyk realised that the
idea of a Church that was half Eastern, half Western was hardly
inspiring. Indeed, he saw that Uniatism had developed a distinct and
rather effete psychology. "The eternal sore spot of our Church is this
internal lack of specificity, lack of independence in life, this blind and
uncontrolled submission to foreign influences," he wrote in 1926 in A
New Age for our Church. The Orthodox East was too great, too

June 1939. WAP-P, ABGK 5575, p. 688. On 7 October 1934, at the opening of the
third academic year of the L'viv Theological Academy, Nvva's correspondent
noted with satisfaction that the student choir sang a psalm in Ukrainian rather
than Church Slavonic. Nvva no. 10, October 1934, 367.

different from the West, and too vital to be attracted to a Union
dominated by "the psychology of an appendage."708
Critics of the Byzantine orientation could argue, of course, that
rather than bring the Orthodox to the Greek-Catholic Church,
Byzantinism would draw Greek-Catholics to the Orthodox Church.
The fact that Fr. Kostel'nyk would lead the union of the Greek-
Catholic Church with the Russian Orthodox Church in 1945-1946
appears to lend credit to such a prediction. However, Fr. Kostelnyk
had spoken out clearly against Orthodox schism, and his later
actions can be explained better by the dire circumstances of both his
own life and that of his Church during and after World War II.
The Byzantine orientation also necessitated a clarification of
the Church's attitude to contemporary Orthodoxy. Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi repeatedly showed a dignified sympathy for and an
understanding of Orthodoxy in its various aspects. A number of
Greek-Catholic priests had an opportunity to observe the Russian
Orthodox Church on visits to Ukraine before World War 1.
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi had done so himself in 1887, and during
and after his confinement in 1914-1917 was able to develop his ideas
on Union through contact with Orthodox clergy. Some Greek-
Catholic priests or seminarians found themselves in Ukraine or
Russia proper as soldiers or military chaplains in the Austrian or
Ukrainian Galician armies. The typical criticism of Russian
Orthodoxy centered on its status as a state Church, whence the
appelation tsareslavii p . At the same time, an attempt was made to
discover genuine Eastern church traditions which could be
reintroduced in the Greek-Catholic Church and which could also
serve as a guide to an eventual Union with the various Orthodox
Churches. As Rev. Iuliian Dzerovych noted in 1916, one of the lessons
of the Russian occupation had been that one could not assume that a
blind clinging to ritual in the manner of the Russophiles would
attract the Orthodox to the Greek-Catholic Church. For the Russians
who had attended Greek-Catholic services had been attracted
precisely by the customs that the Russophiles had condemned as
Latin importations, such as supplications, May devotions, and use of
bells and monstrances.709

218
The possibility of Union with the Russian Orthodox was
frustrated by the Bolshevik take-over, but the inclusion of Voihynia
and the Chehn region in interwar Poland raised the question of
relations with the Orthodox of those lands. These Orthodox
themselves were faced with the issue of cultural identity, torn among
Russian, Belorussian and Ukrainian traditions and political
loyalties. However slim the chances of a Union based on common
Ukrainian traditions might have been, the neo-Union movement
pursued by the Jesuits and supported by the Polish government as
well as the Roman Catholic episcopate, centered as it was on Russian
traditions, was opposed by Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and his clergy.
The notion of converting the former Uniates of these regions to a
Muscovite-rite Catholicism was as repugnant to the Galician Greek-
Catholics as the practice of converting them to the Latin rite.
However, after the 1925 Concordat the Galician Greek-Catholic
bishops were left with no jurisdiction in these regions nor any
possibility of proselytism. They could, of course, take a bitter
satisfaction in the dismal failure of the neo-Uniate movement.
However, when the government condoned the massive vandalism of
Orthodox churches in eastern Poland in 1938, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi protested vehemently in a pastoral letter dated 2 August
of that year. It seems most likely that his objection was motivated
mainly by the realisaton that a Catholic Church implicated in such
forcible "conversion" would never gain the trust, much less the
allegiance, of the Orthodox. 710 All the same it is notable that the
Metropolitan defended the Orthodox despite their Church's
aggressive proselytising among the Greek-Catholic Lemkos.
As far as can be ascertained, the rank-and-file Greek-Catholic
clergy shared Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi' s attitudes towards
Orthodoxy, though probably not his deeper concerns with the
question of Union. Certainly the editors of Nyva considered good
relations with the Orthodox important, and in their 1939 article on
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's forty years in the episcopate stressed that
the Holy See had called for a deeper understanding of the Orthodox
East. Furthermore, only a charitable attitude to what had once been

referred to as the "schismatics" could further the Greek-Catholic
Church's special mission in the East:
