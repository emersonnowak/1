situation of Church and people, combined with their greater activity
and zeal for self-improvement, pointed to a better future for the
national cause. A turning-point had been reached, he felt, and the
heralded reforms would find fertile ground. 162 Nevertheless,
Levyts'kyi was conscious of the low repute in which seminarians
were held:
It is an indisputable fact that every intelligent
Ruthenian person has a kind of strangely
reserved attitude towards the Ruthenian
theological seminary....
You'll meet some secular person -- an older
or younger person, or let's say a university
student -- and as soon as you start talking about
the seminary, you'll hear ridicule and jokes
about the laziness, shiftlessness, card-playing
and similar "virtues" of Ruthenian
seminarians. Nowadays any gymnasium pupil,
raised under the wing of the Ruthenian youth
leaders of L'viv, will give you a similar opinion
about the seminary.
A large portion of secondary school graduates
comes to the seminary with the same prejudice.
What's more, even among the accused, among
the seminarians themselves, you'll find those
who'll sing you the same song about the
seminary. 163

Levyts'kyi recognises that this poor public image is not
altogether unjustified, but considers it exaggerated:
I shall try to demonstrate that the Lviv
seminary is not a house of loafers and
freeloaders, that it is not a Galician Monaco, as
Hromads'kyi Holos wrote last year. But I do not
mean to say that our institution is ideal. This
would be the opposite extreme. There are quite a
few faults and lackings, their correction is
needed and necessary, and we probably won't
have to wait long for it. All the same time,
looking at matters as they now stand, taking all
the circumstances into account, we must draw a
conclusion that is far removed from what I
mentioned before.'64
Levyts'kyi feels that all the evils of the seminary can be traced
to the conditions in which the seminarians are forced to live. First
among these is overcrowding:
Where eight or nine people live at a single
"address," there can be no thought of serious
work. And it is difficult for the seminarians to be
housed so that people with like personalities
should end up together. If one wants to read,
another to write, and at the same time a third to
play the violin, a fourth to sing, a fifth to dance,
etc., what can be the result of all this? True, the
seminary has museums where one can study,
but each museum must accommodate, on the
average, 80 persons, and these are young, lively
persons. And this is the greatest cause of the
"shiftlessness" of the seminarians.
Whoever is determined and makes up his
mind will really prevail and will find the time
and room to work -- but not everyone, and not for
long. After a short while, each sleepless hour
and even the shortest time spent in some cold
corner will affect the health of such a
seminarian. To all this one must add the dust
and the unhealthful air in general, which in a
closeted and sedentary life affect one's health
most adversely. It is a fact that the greater part
of the seminarians belong in a hospital rather
than in a seminary. Stomach ailments,
headaches, anemia, all kinds of catarrh, which
plague a seminarian throughout his four years -
- this is the blessing of the seminary, this is the
164   Levytskyi 5.
63
incentive for intensive work! The same thing,
incidentally, happens n other seminaries as
well.165
In addition, the author mentions the lack of an adequate
library, the students' helplessness and impracticality, the absence of
educational guidance and leadership, and the low pay of the prefects,
who must seek outside work to supplement their incomes. Thus, he
concludes, seminarians cannot be judged by the same standards as
their more fortunate colleagues in secular institutions. Nevertheless,
Levyts'kyi feels that spiritual life in the seminary is not as benighted
as some may think. 166
Another seminarian, Osyp Ostashevs'kyi, writing in December
1913, relates that the students of 190 1-1902 were conscious of a need
for reform. He explains that Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, "following the
life of the seminarians, saw great lackings in their education, and
knew that such an education could not provide a clergy that would
correspond to the religious-cultural demands of its people and of the
present age." Furthermore, Ostashevs'kyi recounts that "our society
understood the importance of reform, for it knew that the
consequences of a reform would go beyond the walls of the seminary
and spread out in a beneficial stream amongst the entire people, and
therefore in 1901 our press spoke of it with joy." 167
Petro Mel'nychuk, not an eyewitness to pre-reform seminary
life but, as biographer of the post-reform rector (and subsequent
Bishop of Stanyslaviv) Rev. Hryhorii Khomyshyn presumably
familiar with relevant documents, relates that late nineteenth-
century students of the L'viv seminary were not particularly
dedicated to study, due to the lack of spiritual or academic leadership.
Aside from morning mass, lectures, and evening prayer, their time
was their own, and few were serious about theology. Some took
advantage of their access to secular university courses to become
teachers. But many spent their free time playing cards or going out
into the town and returning late. In the mornings, he relates, the
spiritual director would visit the rooms to make sure that all had

gone to liturgy. To evade his inspection, students would hide under
their beds; others would lurk in wardrobes and make startling
noises, sending him scurrying away muttering about the "unclean
powers" haunting the rooms. 168 While Mel'nychuk's description has
the ring of student lore and may have been affected by a desire to
underscore the importance of the reforms, it does convey something
of the superficiality widely thought to have characterised pre-reform
seminary life.
Thus, there was a general feeling in Galician Ruthenian
society at the turn of the century that the L'viv seminary was in need
of reform. However, judgments of the spiritual, academic and even
material level of seminary life necessarily depended on the frame of
reference. For example, in comparison with life in nineteenth-
century Russia's Orthodox seminaries -- a comparison that
Russophile clergy might have made -- the L'viv seminary might not
have appeared so deficient. 169 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's frame of
reference, and that of both the spiritual father at L'viv Rev. Isydor
Dol'nyts'kyi (educated at the Greek College in Rome) and the Rev.
Hryhorii Khomyshyn (educated in Vienna and rector at L'viv in 1902-
1904), was most likely the level of education prevailing in the central
and western European seminaries with which they all were
familiar. To the Russophiles, however, imitation of western
European and particularly Jesuit models would only augment the
already alarming degree of latinisation and polonisation in the
education of the Ruthenian clergy. 170 For at least some of the
seminarians and the lay public, the test of the quality of seminary
education was whether it could produce a clergy capable of
participating in the Ruthenian-Ukrainian national revival. Both
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's pastoral letter and Iaroslav Levyts'kyi's
comments also reveal a concern for the public image of the
seminarian and, ultimately, of the clergy itself. Those in favour of
reform realised that in order to eliminate the faults and abuses that
were grist for the Radicals' anti-clerical mill -- lazy, dissolute priests,
exorbitant sacramental fees, clerical obscurantism -- they would
have to start at the level of the seminary.

Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's reform of the L'viv seminary was
radical. It was completely re-organised, nearly all the personnel
were replaced, and the rules were simplified. A major role was
played by the Rev. Dol'nyts'kyi, who had already done much to settle
earlier liturgical controversies. 171 To improve spiritual life the
Basilian monks (who themselves had been reformed, by the Jesuits,
in 1882) were brought in to give retreats. 172
Was the reform successful? The best measure is the quality of
the priests that it ultimately produced. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's
biographer Cyrille Korolevskij, a French priest who adopted the
Byzantine rite (and a Slavic pseudonym), finds that "with the
progress made after the reform of the seminary, the metropolitan
possessed a respectable number of priests who had been very
correctly instructed and educated, and who were in no way inferior to
the best members of the Polish clergy." 173
4. Seminary Life
Under the prescriptions of the L'viv Ruthenian Provincial
Synod of 1891, priority in entrance to the seminary was to be given to
those who had shown signs of a priestly vocation. 174 Under the
reformed rules of the L'viv seminary, an entrant must have
completed secondary school and passed the matura examination.
With his application addressed to the metropolitan, he must submit,
besides his matura certificate, a certificate of baptism and
confirmation and evidence of irreproachable conduct and of good
health. An applicant requiring room and board must be prepared to
pay for them. Those applying from other eparchies must have their
bishop's consent. A satisfactory knowledge of Latin was required for
entrance to the Faculty of Philosophy of the L'viv seminary (as re-
organised in 1928 with Academy status), and in addition, Greek was
required for the Faculty of Theology. 175

seminarians (albeit in union with Rome) are being educated in a Polish and
Roman Catholic spirit.

Under Austria, the state funded seminary education and
strictly limited the number of places. 176 Under Poland, these matters
were covered by the 1925 Concordat with the Holy See. The number of
applicants was often high in relation to the number admitted. In
1921, out of 150 applicants to the expanded L'viv seminary (now
offering its own courses), only 56 were accepted. 177 An applicant who
entered ten years later recalls that "in those times, it was not easy to
get into this one Ukrainian higher school, for there were more
candidates than places in the Theological Seminary." He adds that
many entrants did not graduate; of the more than 200 admitted in the
winter of 1931, only 58 completed the L'viv Academy's five-year
course in 1936. 178
What, aside from a vocation, motivated young men to enter the
seminary? Whereas in the nineteenth century, Sons of priests studied
theology as a matter of course (see Chapter Four), the entry into this
former caste of young men of other social backgrounds in the
twentieth century, as discussed below, was often accompanied by an
idealistic motivation. In the changed social climate after the World
War, a priest's son readily could be expected to enter a secular
profession as readily as the priesthood. The choice of seminary was
no longer automatic, and required a strong vocation or other motives.
In 1923 Bohdan Nehrebets'kyi, a priest's son who had studied
medicine and taken part in the Austrian defence of Peremyshl',
where he was taken prisoner and sent to Siberia, applied to the
Peremyshl' seminary. Among the motives that he mentioned in his
application were a desire to help the suffering, for both humane and
religious reasons. He had thought deeply about the war and the
Russian revolution, he explained, and had sought the causes of
physical suffering and human bestiality. Men's minds had become
materialistic, and they ignored the commands of the Decalogue; thus,
there had been a decline in ethics and morals. The people's soul, he
felt, could only be healed by coming "back to Christ" -- and

67
Nehrebets'kyi had resolved to spread this slogan among the masses
as a priest. 179
There could be other reasons for a Ukrainian to wish to enter a
seminary in Polish-ruled Galicia. Ukrainians could enter Polish
universities only with the greatest difficulty. A numerus clausus was
imposed that excluded most Ukrainians unable to call on high
connections or pay bribes, or unwilling to change over to the Latin
rite (and thereby adopt Polish nationality). Few had the funds to
study abroad. For many, the seminary offered the only opportunity for
higher education (although the Vatican, possibly under pressure
from Polish circles, did not accord even the Academy the status of a
degree-granting university 180). This, writes one graduate of the
Greek-Catholic Academy, was the reason for the multitude of
"vocations" in the inter-war period. He adds that some may have
been motivated by purely material considerations. 181 Such motives
were probably more widespread in the 1930s Depression.
The social composition of Greek-Catholic seminarians
changed between the 1890s and the 1930s. In 1894, about half the
alumni at Peremyshi' -- 13 out of 25 -- were sons of priests. Five were
sons of peasants, three of townsmen. In 1900 and 1904, just under
one-third of the alumni (seven out of 24 and six out of 19, respectively)
came from priestly families; in 1900 peasants' sons already
outnumbered those of priests. Although the proportion of priests'
sons remained roughly the same (close th one-third) in 1914 and 1921,
peasants' or farmers' sons (the terminology in the records varies)
outnumbered them in those years and in 1922 through 1924, with the
proportion of clerics' sons falling to one out of seven, three out of 20
and six out of 35 at Peremyshi' in those latter three years. Among the
other seminarians at Peremyshi' between 1894 and1924 were sons of
townsmen, teachers, church cantors, judicial officials, smiths, and
workers or craftsmen. 182 A similar mix was to be found at L'viv,
where there were students not only from all of Galicia but also from

Eastern Ukraine, Volhynia, Bukovyna, Carpatho-Ukraine,
Yugoslavia, Germany, North America and elsewhere. 183 A 1936
graduate of the L'viv Academy recalls that priests' Sons constituted
only some ten percent of the students in his time, the rest being sons
of peasants, townsmen "and very rarely, of the intelligentsia." They
varied in age from 17 to 40. 184 Some seminarians were also war
veterans. Between 1920 and 1926, almost all the students of the L'viv
seminary had completed military service and had fought in the
world war or the Polish-Ukrainian war. 185
As suggested above, the spiritual life, physical conditions and
discipline in the seminary were all related. Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi's reforms announced in his pastoral letter of 1901 were
aimed at improving all three, along with the academic level. They
were incorporated in the revised statute of the L'viv theological
seminary (and later academy). These supplemented the decisions of
the 1891 Provincial Synod. 186
Spiritual life was naturally of prime importance. Seminarians
were expected to make weekly confession and daily examination of
conscience, to take frequent communion, to engage in spiritual
reading, pray frequently before the Blessed Sacrament and cultivate
especial reverence for the Blessed Virgin Mary. Besides participating
in all the services in the seminary chapel, they were to take part in
festive services in the cathedral of St. George, both on major religious
holidays and during Ukrainian national celebrations. 187
Seminarians must also be spiritually prepared for self-denial and
sacrifice. 188 They were to give alms insofar as possible. They were
encouraged to master practical subjects that could enable them to
serve their neighbour in the future. Each year, they must make an
eight-day retreat, with a special three or five-day retreat just before

ordination. A seminarian who did not take religious practices
seriously and zealously, instead performing them merely out of
obligation and exhibiting a worldly spirit, was to consider himself
lacking a vocation and must leave the seminary at once. Obedience,
brotherly love and solidarity were also to be cultivated. 189
The rules regulated discipline and physical conditions quite
explicitly. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's 1901 pastoral letter had
warned seminarians to avoid the influence of those who liked "cards,
debts and wine," 190 and accordingly, the revised rules forbade cards
or gambling, warned against debts, and prohibited alcohol in the
rooms, listing drunkenness among the grounds for expulsion. 191
Strolls outside the seminary walls were limited to two hours, and
must be undertaken in pairs; seminarians could not visit inns,
restaurants, cinemas, theatres or concert halls, or attend balls,
public festivities or meetings. 192 Smoking was allowed, but only in
the garden and in the students' rooms, and never between evening
prayers and breakfast. 193 Seminarians could not engage in editing or
contributing to periodicals without the rector's permission. 194 The
rules regulated hygiene, courtesy and manners, emphasising that
conversations must be carried on calmly, decently, and to the point,
"as befits a civilised person." 195 The framers of the rules apparently
were conscious of a need to improve the public image of the
seminarians (and presumably of the clergy as a whole), for they
exhorted them to avoid coarse language and behaviour in public, ill
befitting priestly dignity. In particular, loud talk or laughter,
shouting, looking about, loitering before shop-windows or staring at
passers-by, or waving one's arms about, were discouraged.' 96 Twice
a week during the academic year, seminarians were to take a two-
hour walk in groups of four comprising one student from each class,
under the direction of the eldest. 197
The rules encouraged seminarians to admonish each other in
case of infraction of the rules, and should this not be heeded, to

inform their superiors. 198 Obviously, this could be misunderstood as
inviting denunciations, which one unsympathetic source claims
were common. 199 However, in 1920 the dean, Rev. Tyt
Halushchyns'kyi, expelled a student who had informed on a
colleague, and at that time at least, denunciations were discouraged.
Halushchyns'kyi, who served as dean in 1920-1921 and again in 1924-
1925, reportedly had a mild manner of calling seminarians' attention
to their faults, which was very effective.200 Nevertheless, a certain
amount of surveillance over seminarians' activities was inevitable.
Rule 56, requiring students to post letters at a designated box and
never in town, seems to suggest that letters might be read by the
seminary authorities, which the hostile source referred to above
claims as having been the case. 201 Even a sympathetic observer like
Korolevskij finds, in commenting on the ratio of one prefect to fifteen
students, that discipline at L'viv was based on constant supervision
rather than on individual conscience. The supervision extended
beyond the seminary, for even during holidays at home, a
