religious education of their faithful, priests founded parish libraries,
which contained a mix of religious and secular literature. 539 A
special opportunity to raise the moral and spiritual level of the
faithful, which had strong political overtones as well, was the 950th
anniversary of the Baptism of Rus' in 1938.°
A separate aspect of pastoral work was familiarising the
faithful with the social doctrine of the Catholic Church. This was
especially important in Galicia, where rural poverty and, in the
1930s, urban unemployment brought about a political radicalisation
of society. In 1931, on the fortieth anniversary of the encyclical
"Rerum novarum" (and before the appearance of the encyclical letter
"Quadragesimo anno" on 15 May of that year), the Bishop of

Peremyshi' issued a letter which was to be read out by every parish
priest on one of the Sundays in May in place of a sermon.541 At a
meeting of the Stara Si!' deanery in June of 1939, the assembled
parish priests resolved to explain to their faithful the Papal
encyclicals on the social question.542
The requirement that priests concern themselves with matters
which, like the social question, lay outside the confines of traditional
pastoral duties, compelled them to "come out of the sacristy" and into
society. There they faced a bewildering variety of social, cultural and
political issues. Some of these issues will be discussed in Chapters
Six through Eight. First, however, it is necessary to survey the
clergy's social relationships beyond the sacristy.
2. Relations with the Secular Intelligentsia
By 1900, the secularisation of Ruthenian Galician society was
well under way. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi seems to have accepted
this process as natural, but felt that the Church had to retain its
position of leadership in the moral and spiritual domain. In concrete
terms this meant that some kind of accommodation would have to be
found between the clergy and the secular intelligentsia. This was not
a simple matter, however, as a significant portion of the
intelligentsia was anti-clerical. Many had come under the influence
of western European socialist ideas as transmitted by their
countrymen from Russian Ukraine such as Mykhailo Drahomanov
and Mykhailo Hrushevs'kyi, and interpreted by local intellectuals
like Ivan Franko and Mykhailo Pavlyk. Anti-clericalism led in some
cases to outright atheism. On the other hand, the persistence of
Russophile notions among the Greek-Catholic clergy alienated many
Populists who otherwise might be sympathetic to religion and the
Catholic Church. 543 Later, when the clergy generally abandoned
541     PEV no. 4, 1931, 53-59 (order no. 2220). For an English translation of
Rerum Novarum, see Kirwan, Joseph, trans. Rerum Novarum. London, 1983.
Some of the ideas of "Rerum Novarum" had already been transmitted through
the pastoral letters of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi which, however, were concerned
specifically with the problems of Galicia. See Krawchuk, Andrii. "Sheptytskyi
and the Ethics of Christian Social Action," in Magocsi, Paul R., ed. Morality
and Reality: the Life and Times of Andrei SheDtvts'kvi. Edmonton, Alberta,

Russophilism and gradually joined first the populist, then the
Ukrainian national movement, they were able to form a rough
coalition with the bulk of the secular intelligentsia, who for the most
part had tempered their social radicalism. Only the radical left-wing
intelligentsia on the one hand, and the radical right-wing
nationalists on the other, remained at odds with the clergy. (These
issues will be discussed in detail in Chapters Six and Seven.)
In his first pastoral letter upon assuming the episcopal see of
Stanyslaviv in 1899, Andrei Sheptyts'kyi addressed the problem of the
clergy's relations with the secular intelligentsia. Admitting that the
former were losing ground to the latter with regard to social
influence, he declared that the clergy would not try to regain the lost
ground: "The times when the priests alone represented the
Ukrainian intelligentsia are past, never to ieturn!" In matters of
faith and morals, however, they must retain their leadership of
society. Thus, the clergy were obligated to oppose the Radicals'
doctrine of atheism and the socialists' rejection of the Christian
concepts of family and property. For more and more of the
intelligentsia were becoming non-believers, or regarded Christianity
with rationalistic indifferentism, which essentially was paganism.
To convert them, wrote Bishop Sheptyts'kyi, priests must pray, but
they must also come to understand the intelligentsia and their ideas.
In conversations as well as sermons, they must set out Christian
dogmas with precision.544
One of Sheptyts'kyi's first pastoral letters upon assuming the
Metropolitanate of Halych in 1901 was directed to the Ruthenian
intelligentsia. Rejecting the notion that Christianity was a purely
private matter, he asserted that it was a norm of social life that could
play a unifying role in a society threatened by the loss of ethical
principles and divided in terms of social ideals.545

In his August, 1905 pastoral letter to his clergy, Bishop
Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv asserted that on the whole, the secular
intelligentsia remained in the Church, but had allowed itself to be
terrorised by a few Godless individuals. Most of the intelligentsia
were passive, he wrote, and not even a small group could be found
who would dedicate themselves to Christian work. Meanwhile, the
press and belles-lettres continued to assail Christian morality, the
faith, and the Church.546
The friendly social relations between the largely Old
Ruthenian or Russophile clerical caste and the secular intelligentsia
in one district of Galicia were mentioned in the previous chapter.
These of course were not universal, particularly with the growth and
increasing militancy of the populist and radical socialist movements.
An example of the sort of conflict that could arise was that which
occurred in the Lemko region in 1902 between Fr. Teofil'
Kachmarchyk, Fr. Ivanyshov and other lay and clerical Russophiles
on the one hand, and Vasyl' Iavors'kyi and Petro Linyns'kyi on the
other. The latter were government officials and deputies as well as
lay activists with a Ukrainian populist orientation, who had
organised a Ruthenian students' home in Nowy Scz for the poor,
ignorant Lemko population. Their efforts were attacked by the
Russophile priests, who reportedly called them atheists. "From
ancient times," wrote Iavors'kyi, "our Clergy has not shut itself off
from secular people with a Chinese wall, as in the West, where
'schweigt der Laie'; on the contrary, our clergy sought to join the
laity to them..." Fr. Kachmarchyk, however, had "dug a chasm
between the clerical and lay people." The lay activists wished th work
with the people, and they sought cooperation, not obstruction, from
the clergy.547
To some Polish critics of the Greek-Catholic Church, conflicts
between the emerging Ukrainian secular intelligentsia and their
clergy proved the latter's ineffectiveness. Spiritually weakened by the
Josephinist tradition, Greek-Catholic priests had little influence on

the people and none on the intelligentsia, wrote an anonymous
author in 1912. He quoted a Fr. Szczepkowicz, who had stated that the
Ruthenian intelligentsia, which opposed the clergy and Christianity
itself, were pushing the priests out of the educational and economic
institutions which the clergy had helped to found. In 1908 "Prosvita"
(the enlightenment society founded in 1868 by Greek-Catholic priest
Fr. Stepan Kachala) had published a brochure advocating free-
thinking and secular schools, and the daily newspaper "Dilo" had
demanded emancipation of school youth from religious
influences.548
In 1916, "Fr. S.M. from B." confronted the problem squarely, if
pseudonymously, in the pages of Nyva. The clergy were complaining
that the intelligentsia had become alienated from the Church,
indifferent, even hostile. However, it was the priests themselves who
were at fault, for they had failed to educate and inspire the
intelligentsia, to draw them closer to the Church. "The best proof of
this is all those members of the intelligentsia who, having married
Polish women, so readily abandon what is theirs.... Sometimes when
they enter a [Greek-Catholic] church they at times act as if they were
in a Chinese or Indian pagoda." It was not that they were atheists or
Freemasons; many, indeed, were more or less religious, and some
would defend the Church on behalf of the people. The problem was
that they did not understand the close ties between Church and
people.549
The alarm expressed by some of the Greek-Catholic parish
priests and bishops about the anti-clerical attitudes of the
intelligentsia were not greatly exaggerated. In 1921 Anton Korczok
characterised the Ukrainian Galician intelligentsia as often
indifferent to religion, opposed to the Union, and even atheistic.
Priests' sons had converted to Orthodoxy or joined the Freemasons.
The Ukrainian press was anti-religious.550
In the Peremyshl' eparchy in the 1920s some members of the
intelligentsia blamed Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi and his chosen clergy for

the ongoing conflicts. Unlike the earlier strife in the Lemko region,
this was not a battle between Russophiles and populists, but
apparently a power struggle between the higher clergy and a group
of intelligentsia joined by dissatisfied priests. One of the disputes
involved the ancient brotherhood of St. Nicholas at the Peremyshl'
Greek-Catholic Cathedral, which cared for pupils and students.
Among the priestly and lay members was nearly the entire
Ukrainian intelligentsia of the town. Fr. Konstantyn Bohachevs'kyi,
one of Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi's appointees (and a future bishop and
metropolitan in the United States) allegedly removed the more
prominent members of the intelligentsia from the brotherhood,
leading it "nearly to its downfall."55'
The clergy also encountered the lay intelligentsia in various
secular organisations. As mentioned in Chapter One, the L'viv
seminary prepared candidate priests for parish life through extra-
curricular activities such as the reading-room and similar clubs,
and in 1926 the "Prosvita" Society in L'viv invited seminarians to give
talks at various reading-rooms throughout the city. 552 Although
"Prosvita" was intended for the education of the peasant masses, it
was directed by the clerical and lay intelligentsia, and became a
battleground of their conflicting interests. The conflict became acute
in the first years after the world war, when a number of branches of
"Prosvita" came under the domination of extreme left-wing
elements. The purging of these elements from the organisation in
the mid-1920s made clerical cooperation again possible. However, the
influence of nationalist elements in the 1930s caused new tensions
between the lay and clerical "Prosvita" activists.
In the meantime, a debate arose amongst the clergy regarding
participation in secular organisations. Some favoured more active
participation, arguing that this could increase the Church's
influence and avert a take-over by Radical, Communist or other
hostile elements. Others felt that by taking part in organisations
already controlled by anti-Catholic elements, priests would be
publicly lending their support and approval to hostile movements. In

1927 a contributor to "Nova Zoria" identifying himself only as "a
young priest" wrote that the clergy must frequently visit social
organisations and play a leading role in them, lest they be lost to the
anti-Christian camp. Priests must "pour a Christian spirit" into
Ukrainian institutions; otherwise, there would be sects in every
village, the churches would be empty, and the faithful would turn to
Communism. Indeed, the clergy must "take active part in all
manifestations of civic life -- even if we are not invited." They must be
active in the reading-rooms; this was a matter of their very survival.
In particular, "Prosvita" must be saved from the enemy. 553 In the
Peremyshi' eparchy Fr. losyf Il'nyts'kyi said at the Turka deanery
meeting in May of 1927 that priests should be in the community
councils, and the dean urged his priests to draw the intelligentsia
closer to the clergy, since the intelligentsia were in a position to
influence the spirit of the people. 554 At the Rudky deanery meeting in
that same month, however, opinions were divided: Fr. Onyshkevych
felt that the priests should be active in Ukrainian institutions, but Fr.
Kondrats'kyi advised that they should decisively break all ties with
the Ukrainian intelligentsia, since it was hostile to clergy and
Church. Having been driven by the intelligentsia out of the very
institutions they had created, the priests should instead form
exclusively priestly institutions.555
In the Stanyslaviv eparchy, the debate ended when, as
mentioned above, Bishop Khomyshyn decided that his clergy must
found their own organisations and avoid participation in secular
institutions. He proceeded to set up his own press and reading-room
society under the name "Skala" -- "the Rock." In 1937 a priest of the
Stanyslaviv eparchy anonymously wrote a book, published by "Skala,"
in which he sought to demonstrate the error of priests who had
participated heavily in lay organisations. He cited the example of a
priest who had served the same parish for 35 years. His first task had
been to found the parish reading-room. "The priest must come out of
the sacristy," this priest used to say, "and go out among the people
into the reading-room..." Yet after 30 years of tireless work he was
excluded from the organisation. The author concluded that a priest

must influence the reading-room not as a mere member or even a
director, but as a priest, speaking from the pulpit or in the
confessional with the benefit of his clerical authority. He must also
pray for the reading-room and its members.556
The author, who evidently had been active since the early
1900s, criticised priests who used to associate with "various kinds of
gentlemen from town, often Radicals, atheists and schismatics, open
enemies of the Bishop, the Church and the clergy," simply because
they were reading-room activists and patriots, and prided themselves
on being called "active" priests who "were with the people." Such
priests had misled the faithful by tacitly approving of the activities of
the enemies of the Church. At a deanery meeting in the early 1900s,
he recounted, a priest had advocated founding a reading-room in
every parish. When one of his colleagues objected that the local
Prosvita activists were Radicals, he had confidently replied that "the
Devil isn't as terrible as he is made out to be," and that they would
take care of the Radical threat. He then proudly exhibited his
reading-room, which contained various anti-clerical publications
and portraits of writers like the anti-clerical Ivan Franko. Asked
why there were no missionary tracts or holy pictures in the room, he
replied that such questions were redolent of clericalism, which he
regarded as even more harmful than Radicalism. The majority of
the priests present agreed. On another occasion around 1910, four
priests took part in a civic rally held on the Sunday of the Sacred
Heart, while 200 paces away a solemn service and procession were
taking place. 557 The anonymous author from the Stanyslaviv eparchy
felt that in their zeal to cooperate with the secular intelligentsia, the
clergy had simply been deceived:
Our secular intellectuals, popular activists in
our cities and towns, the so-called 'gentlemen
from town,' from our various branch
institutions, cleverly concealed their leftist
convictions for a while and calmly collaborated
with the clerical activists until, as they say, they
'got their feathers,' that is, until with the help of
the priests they gained the confidence of the
blind masses and a strong position in the
institutions. Now, thanks chiefly to the activist
priests, who used to support them before the
556   Prosvitnvi rukh v Halvchvni. L'viv, 1937, 33-36.
Prosvitnvi rukh 60-66.
168
people at all times and places, they have attained
significant influence and have ceased to hide
their leftist views and in their impetus they are
going too far. It is becoming all too obvious that
many of them are abusing their positions in
popular institutions for ruinous and openly
atheist agitation, to the harm of Church and
people.558
Meanwhile the priests who had founded the reading-rooms
and other popular institutions and had brought the intelligentsia
into them were being forced out by that same intelligentsia. The
"Prosvita" reading-room was "no longer a field of work, but a field of
battle." Yet it was prudence, not cowardice, to retreat from this
pointless battle and retrench in a stronger, defensible position. Such
a position was Bishop Khomyshyn's reading-room network "Skala."
But first, priests must break with the lay intelligentsia, withdraw
from the secular reading-room organisations, and avoid the
company of the enemies of the Church.559
Whether or not the attitudes of the intelligentsia in the L'viv
and Peremyshi' eparchies resembled what Bishop Khomyshyn and
his clergy perceived them to be in Stanyslaviv, clerical attitudes there
were altogether different. As was mentioned in the previous chapter,
in 1938 Bishop Khomyshyn forbade his clergy to read Nyva
(published in L'viv with the approval of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi)
because in the previous year it had disagreed with his prohibition of
clerical participation in secular organisations and public events.560
Nyva expressed what was probably the opinion of most parish
priests in the L'viv and Peremyshi' eparchies, if not in the
Stanyslaviv eparchy, on this point. As will be seen below, priests
continued to be active in organised social life. Several priests
ordained in the Peremyshi' eparchy in the 1930s responded in
interviews or questionnaires either that they had entertained good
relations with the secular intelligentsia or that there was no
Ukrainian intelligentsia in their parishes at all; one, however, had
experienced difficulties with a lay Russophile.561

3. Relations with the Countryside
"Peasantry" is a misleading term for the majority of a village
priest's parishioners. They varied from well-off farmers of serf
ancestry who lived better than many members of the petty gentry, to
landless day-labourers. Some were in the process of entering the
town or village intelligentsia -- typically through the reading-room
founded by the local priest. Thus, they were not a clear-cut or mono-
lithic group. However, because the sources refer to them separately
(sometimes as "peasants" or "villagers," sometimes as "the people"),
and because their occupation with agriculture or crafts did distin-
guish them from the professionals of the intelligentsia, they will be
dealt with here -- with some reservations -- as if they constituted a
"peasant class."
"Peasant" attitudes towards the clergy remain an object of
mystery, and the myth of the inscrutable peasant has done little to
elucidate the matter. Evhen Olesnyts'kyi wrote that when he arrived
in Stryi in 1891, the peasantry in the surrounding countryside was
benighted and lacking in national or political consciousness. The
peasants listened to the priests and followed their example, for what
the priest said they considered sacred. 562 On the other hand, in 1912
a Polish author, the pseudonymous "Z.X.Y.," remarked that it was
not strange that the Ruthenians' "respect" for the Greek-Catholic
priest was like that of the schismatics for their p.. For the peasants
trusted the landlord or the Jew or even the Radical more than their
parish priest. In every parish, he claimed, the sacristan or the
parish council opposed the pastor. In every secular activity --
political, eduitiona1, economic -- the priest was being pushed aside,
or else kept on merely for appearances. Often at meetings one could
hear the slogan, "Away with the priests!"563
This description resembles the relations between clergy and
intelligentsia described in the preceding section. Was it typical of the
priest's relations with his peasant faithful? Certainly conflicts did
occur in the economic sphere, and those should be examined first.
In a January 1901 pastoral letter to the clergy "On the Dignity
and Obligations of Priests," Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi declared that
the clergy must come closer to the people, so that they might "fill the
562   Olesnytskyi, Evhen. Storinkv z moho zhtia. L'viv, 1935. Part II, 21.

170
chasm that because of differing social status could divide the priests
from the faithful." In particular, the priest must allow his own
feelings of mercy to be awakened by a closer familiarity with the
plight of the peasantry:
Let him once enter a smoky hut where the
poor live; let him look at the hard bed on which they
sleep; let him take a breath of the close air which they
breathe; let him touch those hands, black and
cracked from hard labour, of people who are his
brothers; let him taste a piece of the dry bread which
is their sustenance; let him ask how much they earn
a day, what they live from, what their work is like,
what are their entertainments, their pleasures.564
Marxist authors have made much of the economic conflicts
between the Greek-Catholic clergy and their parishioners. 565 Priests
commonly hired labourers to help till their land, or rented it out --
often to the wealthier peasants, since the poor could not be counted
on to pay the rent. In such a situation, occasional disputes were
inevitable. 566 The contrasts in wealth between some priests and some
peasants aroused resentment. Oleksander Bryk recounts that in his
village of Kolodiivka, the priest had a nice rectory and large farm
buildings, 60 morg y (about 30 hectares) of land, and hired three
permanent labourers in addition to three female servants, as well as
seasonal workers in the summer. The state paid him a supplement
of 200 forms a year to bring his income up to the guaranteed
minimum. With more than a hint of irony, Bryk recalls that when on
the priest's initiative the congregation built a new church, the priest
was rewarded by being elevated to canon.567
The main source of economic conflict between priest and
peasant, however, were the sacramental fees (treby or iura stolae; see
Chapter Three). In the village of Balyntsi, the parish priest who
preceded Fr. Tyt Voinarovs'kyi had alienated his parishioners in the
1890s by striking a peasant for giving him less than the customary

payment for blessing a house. The peasants had thereafter punished
those of the community who would order masses from this priest.568
As was seen in Chapter One, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi warned the
L'viv seminarians in September 1901 that they must not expect to live
as burdens upon their parishes -- as pastors who milk and shear
their sheep but cannot tend them. 569 In his January 1901 pastoral
letter to the clergy he had warned his priests that they might have to
make sacrifices in order to avoid giving the people an impression of
greed. Priests must not make their services conditional on
contributions by the faithful, lest they become merchants dealing in
holy things.570
These admonitions regarding excessive sacramental fees did
not eliminate the problem. In February 1912 Fr. E. Krynyts'kyi,
reporting to the Peremyshi' episcopal ordinariat on the Tartakiv
deanery meeting, remarked that when a Greek-Catholic priest
raised his sacramental fees, he might discover that a Russophile
agitator or schismatic priest, enjoying Russian financial support,
had promised to perform the sacraments free of charge. In a letter
written in the following month Fr. Anatolii Beskyd, dean at laslo,
remarked that "we must beat our breasts" for the excessive charges
for pastoral services.571 Evidently sensitive to the problem, in 1927 the
Peremyshl' episcopal ordinariat sent a circular letter to its parish
priests recommending moderation in taking sacramental fees, since
misunderstandings might lead to apostasy, and warning that it
would strictly apply canonical regulations to priests who demanded
excessive fees.572 Another warning was published in the eparchial
bulletin in 1931, noting that the number of complaints from the
faithful had increased. With falling prices and unemployment, they
had come upon hard times, and priests should defer to them. 573 In
February 1934, a pseudonymous 70-year-old priest wrote in Nyva

that there were many materialists among the clergy, who sometimes
demanded "mercilessly high payments for church trebv." In this
time of material and spiritual crisis, such individuals stood out in
sharp relief, and one or two of them in a town or a deanery sufficed to
hinder the work of the rest of the local clergy.574
The problem of sacramental fees eventually may have abated
somewhat. At a meeting of the Komarno deanery on 8 June 1939, Fr.
Roman Honchuk gave a talk on the proper conduct of a priest with
doubters, free-thinkers and sectarians in which he described the
economic situation in the deanery. Sacramental fees, he felt, were
not as much of a problem as some laymen would like to think, for the
clergy had learned not to ask too much and had adapted to economic
circumstances. Since the amounts of sacramental fees were not
fixed by law, he added, one had to adapt to local customs and to the
ability of the faithful to pay. In any case, one must avoid conflicts
with the parish.575
Lay perceptions of clerical wealth were not necessarily any
more or less accurate than the clergy's impression of its own poverty
(see Chapter Three). Fr. Honchuk observed:
Nevertheless, in most parishes the status of
priest is an object of envy. When the faithful see
that the benefice fields are larger, and barns
perhaps somewhat bigger than theirs, they
think that priests are rich. But the material
state of a pastor has greatly worsened.
Agriculture had become unprofitable due to the high costs of
cultivation, high taxes, and low prices for farm products.
Furthermore, income from various priestly services, and customary
payments in kind, had fallen.576
Parish economics were only one aspect of the clergy's
relations with the village, though perhaps the most problematical.
Peasant attitudes in matters of faith and morals, while more
important from the Church's point of view, are difficult to divine. As
is so often the case, most of the evidence comes from outsiders --
including those purporting to speak on the peasants' behalf --
whether priests or secular intelligentsia.

At the February 1912 meeting of the Mokriany deanery at
Hrushiv, the gathered priests expressed the view that the
intelligentsia's indifference to religion had begun to affect the
villagers. Furthermore, schoolchildren and university students on
holiday at their families' farms were sowing the seeds of anti-
religious teachings, and often "in one blow destroy the work of the
parish priest." 577 At the Sambir deanery meeting in May of 1939, Fr.
D. Kuzmins'kyi, speaking on "How to Raise the Village from
Religious-Moral Decline," blamed poverty, Bolshevik and Radical
agitation, and the laziness and bad examples of some priests for the
sorry state of affairs.578
Greek-Catholic priests, who to an increasing extent came
from the peasant-farming community, were well aware of the
economic hardships of village life. They thus could continue the
socio-economic work so typical of their nineteenth-century
predecessors with an additional zeal derived from experience. The
clergy of the Stanyslaviv eparchy were urged to take the lead in such
work by their then Bishop Andrei Sheptyts'kyi in 1899. Typical of
socio-economic work was the founding of reading-rooms, discussed
above, as well as of temperance societies, agricultural cooperatives,
financial institutions, insurance funds, and cultural circles. The
efforts of individual priests in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries are well documented. 580 The clergy also participated in
public relief efforts. For example, the Ukrainian Committee for Aid
to the Unemployed and the Poor, based in L'viv and presided over by
a layman, enjoyed the patronage of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and
Bishops Kotsylovs'kyi and Khomyshyn. At the parish level, the priest

The clergy's socio-economic work was sometimes criticised.
In 1899, Metropolitan Sas-Kuilovs'kyi chided parish priests for
founding reading-rooms, which he regarded as harmful. 582 The
