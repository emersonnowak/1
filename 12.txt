bishops circumvented the government's right to object to an
appointment by nominating administrators or transferring priests
from parish to parish. In the 1920s, the L'viv governor was disturbed
by the government's inability to prevent the Greek-Catholic bishops
from transferring nationalist priests from small parishes to
politically significant ones. 351 However, according to one source, it
was generally accepted by the end of the inter-war period that the jj
praenotificationis applied to transfers as well as to appointments of
newly ordained priests. 352 In any case, the placement of Greek-
Catholic priests remained a constant source of tension between
Church and state, and confirmation was often refused or removal
demanded where the priest advocated separate status for the
Ukrainians .353
In the L'viv county (wojewddtw), once the patron had made
his selection from among the candidates proposed by the bishop, the
approval of the county would be sent to the Ministry of Religious
Cults. In the case of Fr. Hryhorii Fukan'chyk, whom the Bishop of
Peremyshi' sought to nominate to a parish in Uhertsi (Lisko district)
in 1933, the governor objected under article 19 of the Concordat
because during his tenure as administrator of that parish, Fr.
Fukan'chyk had "made himself known as an intractable foe of the
Polish State and People, and with his activity has made impossible
the peaceable co-existence of the population of both nationalities."
These assertions were based on detailed representations by the
district starostwa in Lisko. The circumstances were rather unusual,
since the patron had apparently lost possession of the property and
could not exercise the ius prezent y. The Bishop favoured Fr.
Fukan'chyk despite the fact that older priests -- who were allegedly

more loyal to Poland -- had applied for the benefice. Yet it appears
that the Minister of Cults did not find the evidence of Fr.
Fukan'chyk's anti-Polish activity sufficient to establish a threat to
state security, and declined to oppose the nomination. 354 In 1939 the
Apostolic Administrator for the Lemko region sought to install Fr.
Ivan Fenych, parish priest at Voikova in the Nowy Scz district, at
Senkova Volia in the Sianyk (Sanok) district. Passing information
from the administration at Nowy Scz about Fr. Fenych's Ukrainian
nationalist activity, his hostile attitude to the Polish state and his
previous troubles with the law to the Minister of Religious Cults, the
Cracow governor nevertheless stated that under the Ministry's
January 1929 guidelines for application of articles 19 and 20 of the
Concordat, he could not formally protest the priest's nomination to
the benefice. Indeed, the governors in Galicia in the late 1920s and
1930s interpreted the Concordat narrowly regarding threats to state
security, and protests against nominations of Greek-Catholic priests
to benefices were the exception, even in cases where the priest held
Ukrainian nationalist and anti-Polish views or belonged to the
Ukrainian National Democratic Union.355
Patronage
Article 21 of the Concordat, which was never put into effect,
provided that the matter of patronage rights would be regulated in a
separate agreement. The government regarded patronage as an
instrument of nationality policy. In practice, these rights were left as
they had been under the Partitions, except that the time within
which the patron must exercise his right was reduced to thirty
days.356
In Galicia, patronage did give the ordinarily Polish patrons a
certain amount of influence over parish appointments, though the
mechanics of the procedure did not allow them any real control. In
1920 a conflict arose between 34 patrons of parishes in the
Peremyshi' eparchy and the Greek-Catholic episcopal consistory.
The patrons, represented by a lawyer, accused the consistory of

proposing lists of candidates for benefices who it knew would be
unacceptable to them, and of designating as unsuitable candidates
who in fact were above reproach and who "did not hate everything
that is Polish."357 The lawyer complained to the Council of Ministers,
the Ministry of Religious Cults and the provincial authorities that
the episcopal consistory was restricting patronage rights and
assigning benefices to priests who were decided enemies of po1sko6
and agitators schooled to struggle against Polish society. He added
that the consistory was preventing some priests from competing for
certain parishes, thus preventing the patrons from selecting priests
who had a peaceful, conciliatory attitude towards Polish society.
According to the lawyer, the Peremyshi' civic authorities asserted in
1921 that in assigning parishes, the episcopal consistory was
overlooking older, apolitical priests in favour of young candidates
imbued with hatred for polsko.358
In some cases, the patron was the county government. 359 This
presumably rendered objection under article 19 of the Concordat
redundant.
Landed Property
The Austrian laws on state supervision of church and parish
property, particularly the decree of 15 October 1858 and the law of 7
May 1874, remained in effect until the decree of the Council of
Ministers of 25 March 1933 declared them inconsistent with the
Concordat under article 25.360
The Concordat provided for state purchase of church property
under the planned land reform, leaving specified amounts to various
ecclesiastical persons and institutions. For priests, for example, from
15 to 30 hectares of property would be exempt from government
purchase and subsequent parcellation. However, the agrarian
reform, which in any case was slow in coming, never affected
church lands, as church and state continued their quibbling year

after year.36 ' In Galicia, where Church and clergy had some of their
largest landholdings, 362 this might have been resented. However,
since parcellation tended to favour Polish settlers rather than the
local Ukrainians, the Greek-Catholic bishops -- with the exception of
Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv -- avoided parcellation of
church and parish lands. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi introduced
parcellation in the L'viv archeparchy in the 1920s, but was persuaded
to abandon it. The government had neither the funds nor the
commitment to force parcellation, and the Latin-rite bishops were
not interested in carrying it through voluntarily. In fact, Bishop
Khomyshyn was the only bishop in Poland to carry out a full
parcellation. However, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi found another way
of aiding the poverty-stricken priests. Relying on his power under the
Concordat to create and provide materially for new parishes, he
divided existing parishes where there was a maternal and a filial
church, leaving the new parish under the same administrator. The
parish priest could thus receive an additional salary.363
The average size of benefice land of a Greek-Catholic parish
priest in the inter-war period was 52 hectares, compared to 33
hectares for a Latin-rite parish priest. In the L'viv metropolitan
province, the average Greek-Catholic benefice in 1927 measured 52
hectares, the average Latin-rite benefice 48 hectares. Typically, the
priest would rent out the land, though sometimes he would work it
himself.364
One source of friction among priests was the disproportion
among their landholdings. In 1927 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi took the
radical decision of limiting the size of a priest's benefice to 80
hectares. At 2 zloty per hectare per month, such a holding would
bring 160 zloty per month - together with income from other
sources, enough to support a priest and his family. Priests holding
over 80 hectares were obligated to turn over 2 zloty per hectare to the
curial treasury every month. The sums thus collected were then
distributed to priests who had under 80 hectares.365

Some friction seems to have occurred in the Peremyshi'
eparchy after the Concordat came into effect. Among the complaints
raised by some laymen against Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi in a brochure of
1929 was that before nominating a priest to a parish, he allegedly
demanded the income from a part of the parish property. The same
source alleged that in the Stanyslaviv eparchy, the income from an
apricot orchard belonging to a benefice was transferred to the
eparchial cathedral, and the income from a parish field that had
yielded oil was transferred to the episcopal ordinariat.366
Salary (Dotation)
After 1918, the Polish state paid priests the salary that they had
been receiving under Austrian administration. Various new laws
were proposed. A joint clerical-state commission proposed that the
basic clerical salary should be equal to that of civil servants, with
supplements for the high inflation of the time and for seniority. A
government plan was introduced in 1923, pending the conclusion of
the Concordat. The Concordat of 1925 left clerical salaries at the
same level as under the Partitions.367
From 1924, salaries were no longer paid by the state directly to
the priests. Instead, the state would pay the salaries ("dotations") for
the entire diocese to the bishop, who would then distribute them
among his clergy. This rule was retained under the Concordat. A
priest's income would depend on the size of his benefice lands.
However, the rules for clerical income spelled out in the Concordat
were never fully observed, causing some priests to complain. One
Greek-Catholic priest in the Stanyslaviv eparchy, for example,
received a salary despite the fact that he already had a 50-hectare
benefice; another, in the Peremyshi' eparchy, received a salary in
addition to the income from his 100 hectares of land.368
On the whole, however, the Greek-Catholic clergy found itself
impoverished in the wake of wartime destruction and financial
crisis. Its condition was also due in part to its dependence on the
impoverished general population for sacramental fees.369

In 1927, the Latin-rite clergy in the Lviv and Peremyshi'
dioceses received a somewhat higher total income than the Greek-
Catholic clergy of the corresponding eparchies. Although the Latin-
rite clergy of the L'viv metropolitan province received a lower total
income in that year than the Greek-Catholic clergy, the financial
needs of the latter, who in most cases were married, were
considerably greater. 37° Thus, although dividing the annual global
sums designated for the L'viv and Peremyshi' Latin-rite and Greek-
Catholic dioceses in 1933 by the number of clerical positions yields a
higher per capita salary for the Greek-Catholic priests,
considerations of family support (even in Peremyshi', where the
compulsory celibacy introduced in 1925 had only begun to have its
social effect) may modify or even reverse the implications of this
result.37'
The average Catholic priest's monthly salary in Poland in
1935-1936, about 102 or 103 zloty, can be compared to the 130 to 260
zloty earned monthly by 85% of teachers. The latter, however, were
ordinarily entirely dependent on their salaries for their support.372
The average monthly salary for a Greek-Catholic priest in the L'viv
archeparchy in 1933 was about 105 zloty, in the Peremyshi' eparchy
about 111 zloty, based on the calculation referred to in the preceding
paragraph. To this would have to be added his income from land and
other sources, as noted below.
In his negotiations with the Vatican representative
concerning the Concordat in January 1925, Professor Stanislaw
Grabski objected to the proposal that dotations should be paid in
global sums to the diocesan bishops, since certain "disloyal" bishops
might use their financial power to punish priests loyal to the Polish
state. It is clear from the discussion that Professor Grabski had in
mind the Ukrainian bishops, particularly Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi. 373 Certainly the government could control priests'
behaviour more effectively as long as it paid their salaries directly. In
1930, the Supreme Administrative Tribunal heard the case of Fr.
370     Wisocki 229-230, Table 44, p. 229.
371     This calculation is based on AAN, MWR i OP file 398. The yearly
salaries that it yields -- 1264 zloty for L'viv, 1332 zloty for Peremyshl' and 1293
for Stanyslaviv -- can be compared with the 1935-1936 average of 1233 zloty for all
Catholic clergy in Poland. Myslek 124.

Mykola Styslovs'kyi, who claimed back pay that had been withheld by
demand of the L'viv governor in 1924 from May of that year until 30
October 1925, when priests began to receive their salaries from their
bishops. Fr. Styslovs'kyi's salary had been docked apparently because
of his Ukrainian nationalistic activity.374
Once the payment of salaries was entrusted to the bishops,
however, the government sought to use its financial power to
influence them to control their potentially "disloyal" clergy. Thus, in
1934 the Stanyslaviv governor Jagodzirf ski supported the Greek-
Catholic Bishop Ivan Liatyshevs'kyi's request for placement in the
fifth salary category noting that the bishop had considerable
influence among his clergy and was helpful to him in "realising his
plans" regarding them. The government also gave direct material
benefits to priests supporting the Sanacja regime. 375 Greek-Catholic
priests' retirement salaries were manipulated in the same way, and
discrimination between priests of the two rites was practised. At the
same time, Greek-Catholic church authorities were also accused of
financial discrimination on political grounds. 376 For its part, the
government kept files on political activities of both Latin-rite and
Greek-Catholic priests.377
The bishops' control over salary naturally permitted abuses
unrelated to political considerations as well. In a 1926 letter to the
Pope complaining about their bishop's conduct, a group of forty
laymen of the Peremyshi' eparchy accused him of distributing
salaries arbitrarily, increasing or decreasing them depending on
whether he liked a given priest or whether that priest obeyed him.
They noted that under previous Austrian law, a priest was entitled to
an explanation of the amount of his salary and had a right of
appeal.378
Sacramental Fees
Sacramental fees or iura stolae were a source of both income
and controversy for the Greek-Catholic parish clergy. Under the
34    AAN, MWR j OP file 371, pp. 113-118. Since the Tribunal declined to
adjudge the case, it is not clear whether Fr.Styslovs'kyi ever received his back
pay.

Concordat, the government could agree with the bishops of Poland to
abolish the sacramental fees altogether, augmenting dotations by
way of compensation. No such agreement was ever reached. In 1928,
Greek-Catholic and Latin-rite priests charged the same rates in
L'viv county 1, but in Ternopil' county the Greek-Catholic clergy
charged higher fees and in Stanyslaviv county their fees were a
source of many conflicts with their faithful. A funeral could cost
anything from 10 zloty (L'viv county) to 400 (Stanyslaviv). There was
especially great variety in the amounts of the sacramental fees
charged in the Peremyshl' Greek-Catholic eparchy.379
Sacramental fees involved priests of both rites in conflicts with
parishioners, especially with regard to funerals. Some Church
circles denounced abuses. In 1932, Fr. Jan Zieja published a
brochure addressed to his fellow priests on this question; he himself
did not charge sacramental fees at all.380
Miscellaneous Income
Other sources of clerical income included state pay for
catechesis (350-1000 zloty annually), 38 ' fees for masses for special
intentions, 382 chancery fees (e.g. for issuing extracts from parish
records), 383 customary gifts from patrons (relatively rare after the
Austrian period), 384 oil leases, 385 and leases of parish land.386
Net Income
The average monthly net income of a Greek-Catholic parish
priest in Galicia around 1930 was 477 zloty in the L'viv archeparchy,
459 zloty in the Peremyshl' eparchy, and 591 zloty in the Stanyslaviv
eparchy. The corresponding figures for Latin-rite parish priests in

made ample profits. However, he probably does not have in mind the parish
clergy, except in referring to the practice of leasing extra parish land in

the L'viv and Peremyshi' dioceses (there was no Stanyslaviv diocese)
are considerably higher: 602 zloty and 608 zloty, respectively.387
An assistant priest (vicar) was paid by the parish priest out of
the parish treasury. Generally, the assistant was entitled to
maintenance, housing, and a monthly salary, the amount of which
could be decided by the eparchial curia. The assistant could also
receive a part of the income from services, depending on his
participation. 388 It was the custom, at least in the Peremyshl'
eparchy, for the assistant to receive one-third of the dotation, in
money or goods, and of the income from the land (except for orchard
and garden). However, he also had to pay a third of the tax. The
parish priest and his assistant could sign an agreement on the
division of income and expenses, to be confirmed by the episcopal
consi story.389
For purposes of comparison, Wislocki points out that the
average income of a Catholic parish priest was twice the average pay
of a civil servant who, unlike a Latin-rite priest (but like most Greek-
Catholic priests) had to support his family from this amount. The
contrast between a priest's income and that of his poorer peasant
parishioners, especially in the east and south of Poland, was
enormous. Wisocki also points out that although the state dotations
and contributions for masses were in standard amounts, other
elements of a priest's income varied considerably. Although the
dotation itself was low, the cost of living in village parishes was not
high.39°
General Economic Condition
However satisfacthry the salary of an average priest in Poland
might appear, the over-all economic condition of many members of
the Greek-Catholic clergy in Galicia was not enviable. In the
Stanyslaviv eparchy freshly ordained priests, who in the inter-war
period were usually peasants' sons, often found themselves in such
financial straits that they could not afford the journey to their first

parish. In many such cases, Bishop Khomyshyn would provide
financial aid. 39 ' In his Homiletical Lessons, which he sought to
publish in 1922, Fr. Teodor Savoika, parish priest in Selys'ky in the
Peremyshi' eparchy, complained that the Church and her servants
all too often were given donations grudgingly. He pointed out that the
hard household work which priests were forced to perform lowered
the intelligence, taking time away from necessary reading. Priestly
poverty, Fr. Savoika continued, could have important social
implications as well:
And have our communities ever considered
how, through their citizens' lack of benevolence,
and the poverty of the priest, his prestige, his
significance and power in the eyes of the world,
of governments and people of another rite,
another faith and another nationality must fall?
Behold: when in some Ukrainian community a
parish is funded for some persons of the Latin
rite, they try to see to it that the Latin-rite priest
should necessarily have more land -- at least a
few morgv more -- than does ours. Why? Because
everyone knows well that he who has more,
holds his head higher. No one ever got rich with
a skinny horse. And soon, very soon, a poor priest
must fall into debt. He needs a pasture, and fire-
wood, and straw, and something from the
garden, and there's the mill, the road, and a fish
