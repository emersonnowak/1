        Between 1900 and 1939 the Greek-Catholic parish clergy in
 Galicia underwent a transformation of its social, national, political
 and cultural consciousness. In part this was the result of the
 political changes taking place in the province, as its Ruthenian
 population developed a Ukrainian national consciousness expressed
 during the interregnum between Austrian and Polish rule by the
 creation of the Western Ukrainian Popular Republic, and later, in the
increasingly restrictive atmosphere of inter-war Poland, by the
 activity of both moderate and radical nationalist groups. In part this
 transformation was conditioned by the decline of the priestly caste
 and the rise of a new type of priest, usually a celibate of village origin.
The transformation was also the result of a conscious programme
initiated by Metropolitan Andrei Sheptyts'kyi to raise the moral and
educational level of the clergy. To this end he reformed the L'viv
 seminary, established a theological academy, and organised full
seminaries in Stanyslaviv and Peremyshi'. This prepared the parish
priest to deal with a growingly nationalistic and often anti-clerical
intelligentsia, and a village coming increasingly under its influence.
At the same time, the parish clergy evolved a new sense of its
identity, gradually abandoning the Russophile orientation of the Old
Ruthenians and adopting first Ruthenian populism, then Ukrainian
nationalism. Thus they found common cause with the secular
intelligentsia. However, the Ukrainian orientation forced them to
redefine the Eastern Ukrainian tradition in a manner compatible
with Catholicism, and to formulate their stance towards Orthodoxy
and the Kievan Byzantine tradition. Though split between
Byzantinists and Westernisers, the clergy developed a strong sense of
their place as leaders of Galician Ukrainian society, albeit in
occasional competition with the nationalist intelligentsia, and of
their mission as bearers of Catholicism in the East.

       The original plan of this dissertation was to examine the
'mentality" of the Greek-Catholic parish clergy as it developed in the
changing socio-economic, political and cultural circumstances of
Galicia between 1900 and 1939. In the process of assembling the
necessary material it became evident that much fundamental work
had to be done to clarify those changing circumstances themselves,
at least insofar as they affected the clergy. It also became clear that
the reform of clerical education which took place during this time
would have to be dealt with before any assessment could be made of
changes in clerical attitudes. The result has been that tthe first two
chapters of this dissertation are dedicated to clerical education, the
next three to social and economic relations, and the following two to
politics and culture, respectively. In all these chapters, however, a
discussion of changing conditions is combined with examples of
evolving priestly attitudes about these conditions. In this way the
question of "mentality" is treated together with the basic conditions
that influenced it, and clerical perceptions of these conditions are
documented. Only the last chapter deals exclusively with what the
Greek-Catholic parish clergy in Galicia thought about themselves.
That chapter, however, is in part a reflection on material introduced
in earlier chapters, and examines attitudes that arose in reaction to
the conditions previously discussed.
       The fundamental thesis is that over a period of forty years, the
Greek-Catholic clergy in Galicia was transformed in several ways,
partly by design, partly by circumstance. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi,
seeking to bring the priesthood back to a position of social leadership,
reformed the seminaries and sought to create a new, superior type of
priest, prepared to cooperate (or, as necessaary, compete) with the
secular intelligentsia and to evangelise the Orthodox East. At the
same time, the fall of the Habsburg empire and the advent of Polish
rule, the change in the social composition of the clergy, deteriorating
economic conditions and other similar factors contributed to the
metamorphosis of the priestly class.
       Geographical and political factors of course must be
considered in order to understand the setting in which the mentality
of the Greek-Catholic clergy developed. Galicia was the
northeasternmost province of the Austro-Hungarian empire.
                           6

 Politicians and military strategists were well aware of its importance
 as a bulwark against Russia. Peremyshi' (Przemyl) was one of the
 most heavily fortified towns of Europe, and its successive sieges by
 Russians and Austrians were major events in the first world war.
 Perhaps even more keenly felt, however, was the danger of Russian
influence among a population that, in Eastern Galicia, mostly spoke
 an East Slavic language and belonged to a Church which, while
Catholic, bore close resemblance to Orthodoxy. The conversion of a
few Galician priests and villages to Orthodoxy caused concern in
Vienna, which seemed justified by the mass conversions during the
Russian occupation in World War I. In the first decade and a half of
the twentieth century, the politicisation of Galician Russophilism,
which had begun as a purely cultural orientation, provoked alarm in
Vienna which culminated in treason trials and indiscriminate
hangings during the first years of the war.
        At the same time, the fact that the Galician population was
ethnically related to, and in some opinions a part of, the renascent
Ukrainian nation to the east took on increasing importance in the
final decades of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the
twentieth. The arrival of political exiles from the Ukraine reinforced
the Ruthenian intelligentsia's sense of being one people with the
Ukrainians, and this sense filtered down gradually to the peasants,
largely through the mediation of the Greek-Catholic parish clergy.
Austrian statesmen were quick to see the significance of this
alternative to the Russophile orientation. Ukrainian separatism
provided a wedge into Russia, and the Ukrainian orientation in
Galicia gave Austria one more weapon against her neighbour to the
northeast.
        Ukrainian dreams of autonomy or independence paralleled,
and in fact were often inspired by, similar aspirations among the
Poles. The unexpected crumbling of both the Austro-Hungarian and
the Russian empires in the last two years of the world war left Poles
and Ukrainians free to dispute the territories inhabited by both. A
Polish-Ukrainian war over Eastern Galicia immediately ensued,
lasting from November 1918 to July 1919 and ending in defeat for the
Ukrainian Galician Army.
        In the meantime the Eastern Ukrainians had set up an
independent Republic in the wake of the 1917 Russian revolution
                           7

which declared its independence on 22 January 1918, a few days
before the arrival of Bolshevik forces in Kiev. Embattled by Reds and
Whites, with no help from the Russian-oriented Allies, the
Ukrainian Popular Republic found temporary support from the
Germans after Brest-Litovsk, though at the cost of a burdensome
occupation and undue political interference. The conservative regime
of Hetman Skoropadsky crumbled along with the Central Powers
that had supported him. As their Galician brethren were setting up
the Western Ukrainian Popular Republic and battling the Poles, the
Eastern Ukrainians organised a Directory, whose armies sought to
stave off Bolsheviks, Whites, anarchists, and typhus. Finally Symon
Petliura obtained help from JOzef Pi1sudski, though at the cost of
Galicia. The Polish-Ukrainian expedition of May 1920 took Kiev, but
the ensuing Bolshevik counter-attack dispelled the Ukrainian forces
and pushed the Poles back to Warsaw by August. With the "miracle
of the Vistula" Pilsudski was able to drive back the Bolsheviks and
ultimately to carve out a Polish state with ample eastern borders
including a large non-Polish population. Among them were the
former troops of the Ukrainian Galician Army and Petliura's forces.
The vast eastern borderlands proved a liability as well as a buffer for
Poland, for ethnic problems plagued the Polish Republic throughout
the two decades of its existence. Nowhere was this more evident than
in Galicia.
       In the inter-war period Eastern Galicia became for Poland
what it had been for Austria: a buffer against Russia populated by an
element of uncertain political loyalty. Both the Soviet Union and
Germany played upon the grievances of the Ukrainian minority,
extending their influence into subversive organisations. Successive
Polish regimes tried different policies to shore up this important
bulwark, settling ethnically Polish colonists, organising special
border detachments, "pacifying" the population through police and
military action. Ultimately, however, the political orientation of the
Ukrainians of Galicia developed in such a manner as to preclude its
tranquil inclusion in anything other than a Ukrainian state. The
acceptance of this political orientation by the clergy was an important
element in this situation.
       The focus of this study is the transformation of the ideas,
attitudes, and world-view of the Greek-Catholic clergy in Galicia.

How did their sense of national identity and their political allegiance
change? How did their cultural orientation, both sacred and secular,
develop? What did they feel to be their role in Ruthenian or Ukrainian
society, and in the broader context of European Christendom?
      Although given the current state of research it is impossible to
answer these questions definitively, an attempt will be made to
provide tentative answers which may point the way to more fruitful
research.
      The evolution of the mentality of the Greek-Catholic parish
clergy in Galicia has parallels in other times and places. Their
closest neighbours, the Polish Latin-rite clerics, appear to have
undergone changes during the same period which have yet to be
examined in a systematic manner. The socio-economic and
sometimes political activism of Polish priests, particularly in the
Prussian partition, are known. Fr. Stoja1owski 1 and, later, Fr.
Panas 2 were prominent political figures. Many Polish clerics
supported the nationalistic Narodowa Demokracja (Endeky) of
Roman Dmowski. 3 Like the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic priests, Polish
Latin-rite priests sometimes ran afoul of the state authorities
because of their political activities. In fact, a Polish government
memorandum of March 1938 complains of the subversive anti-state
propaganda carried on by clerics engaged in politics.4 But whereas
the political activity of the Polish clergy in the Polish state lacked the
national ingredient that so fired the Ukrainian clergy of the time, the
role of Polish priests in Partition Poland resembled that of the
Ukrainian clergy more closely.
        Religion and nationality have proved a potent mix in many
contexts, and clerics have appeared as the natural leaders of national
movements reinforced by confessional divisions. 5 This was the case
with Greek-Catholic communities in lands adjacent to Galicia --
Hungary, Romania and Slovakia -- as well as further abroad. In the
Kingdom of Hungary, both Romanian and Ruthenian Greek-

Catholics sought to stave off latinisation which, as in Galicia, was
perceived as a means of ethnic assimilation with the dominant
nationality. 6 In Transylvania, however, Orthodoxy had served to
preserve Romanian ethnic identity during Turkish rule, and the fact
that the subsequent Austrian government favoured the Uniates who
had joined with Rome in 1701 put the latter at odds with Romanian
nationalism. 7 In the lands of Transcarpathia and the Preov
(Eperjes) region, which passed from Hungary to Czechoslovakia after
World War I, the Greek-Catholic Church helped to protect the
Ruthenians from assimilation with the Slovaks.8
       Uniate Churches have also flourished in the Middlle East and
India, though not as bulwarks of separate nationality. They are
grouped in churches descended from the Assyrian Church of the
East (the Chaldean and Malabar Churches), from Oriental Orthodox
Churches, and from the Byzantine-rite Orthodox Church (the
Melkite Church). 9 The Armenian Uniates who established
themselves in Poland, whither they had come as merchants, were in
fact centered in L'viv (Lwów). Although they became thoroughly
polonised, they maintained a strong ecclesiastical identity, and
Archbishop J6zef Teodorowicz of L'viv (1902-1938) was a prominent
figure in Poland's Catholic hierarchy.1°

        In the Low Countries, Catholicism became a basis for a
national division when Belgium (the name was taken from a tribe
that existed in Roman times) was created in 1830. However, Brabant
and Limburg have retained significant Protestant Flemish
minorities. At the same time, a sizeable Catholic minority has
remained in Friesland in the Netherlands. 11 In these areas
religious, ethnic and linguistic divisions do not fully coincide.
       It has also happened that the ethnic factor has sparked a new
confessional division. This occurred among Catholic East European
immigrants in the United States, where in the nineteenth century
the Church was heavily Irish. Complaining of polonisation in
Chicago, Lithuanians formed their own national church was
formed in that city in 1906. Disputes over ownership of church
property and appointment of pastors had combined with ethnic
friction to prompt the formation of a Polish Catholic Church. Their
Bishop, Anton Kozlowski, received his orders from the Old Catholic
Church, a European schism that had arisen in the wake of the First
Vatican Council. In 1898 a Polish Independent Catholic Church was
formed in Buffalo, New York under Bishop Stefan Kaminski. By 1907
both these Churches had become affiliated with the Polish National
Catholic Church established in 1900 and based in Scranton,
Pennsylvania, under Bishop Francis Hodur. This Church even
established a mission in Poland.12
       The transformation of the Greek-Catholic parish clergy in
Galicia between 1900 and 1939 can thus be seen in the context of the
interplay of religious and national currents in modernising societies.

 NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY AND TRANSLITERATION

       The very changes that form the background of this thesis are a
 source of difficulty in choosing appropriate terminology. Indeed,
terminology itself was the object of debate and manipulation during
the period under study. Austria ruled the province of Galicia (the
name of which was an eighteenth-century revival of the name of a
medieval Rus' principality) until 1918. Although calls for the
partition of Galicia were not heeded, the division of Galicia into a
predominantly Ruthenian Eastern part and a predominantly Polish
Western part, separated by a line running near the river San, was
recognised. In 1919, after a Polish-Ukrainian struggle of several
months, Poland took the province and, given a mandate by the
Council of Ambassadors in 1923, held it until September 1939. Under
Polish administration, the province came to be officially designated
as Eastern Little Poland (Malopolska Wschodnia). (See Tables.)
       During the period under study, the people who for the most
part called themselves Ruthenians in 1900 came to accept the name
Ukrainians. Although their Church generally retained the Austrian
designation "Greek-Catholic" (formally adopted in 1774), the term
"Ukrainian Catholic" appeared in a document drafted by clergymen
as early as 1914 and by the 1930s was coming into more frequent use.
Even personal names changed during this period: individuals often
polonised Ukrainian family names, and priests who re-Ukrainised
such names in parish records were subjected to prosecution. The
orthography they were to use and, in fact, the very identity of their
language was a subject of heated debate amongst the parish clergy.
The Old Ruthenians used an artificial mixture of Church Slavonic,
Ukrainian and Russian, rendered in an "etymological" orthography,
while the populists opted for the contemporary Ukrainian language
and orthography in their Galician variant. The question was only
resolved in the inter-war period.
       In this dissertation, the name "Galicia" will be retained for
convenience, even with reference to inter-war Eastern Little Poland,
and will include both its eastern and western parts. German and
Polish versions of place-names will be avoided except where clarity
requires their mention, as will current Soviet Russian or Ukrainian
versions that differ from the Ukrainian versions in use during the
period under study. For the sake of uniformity, the Ukrainian
                          12

versions of place-names in Galicia in use during the period 1900-1939
will be used. These, after all, are the versions generally used by the
Greek-Catholic priests themselves; furthermore, the German or
Polish versions of names of small villages would be difficult to
ascertain. Of course, names of Polish cities outside Galicia will be
rendered in Polish, and accepted English versions of names of cities
will be used (e.g., Warsaw, Cracow, Vienna). In citations, however,
the versions of place names used in the sources will be retained.
       On the whole, "Ruthenians" will be used for the period up to
1914, except where the source uses (or most likely used) the
designation "Ukrainian," or where "Ukrainian" is needed to
designate a political orientation. For the period after 1914,
"Ukrainian" will be used unless the source uses "Ruthenian." The
Church and clergy in question will be referred to as "Greek-Catholic"
throughout, except with reference to subsequent events, or in citing
or quoting sources. Ukrainian personal names of course will be
rendered in Ukrainian. In references, the original orthography will
be followed in transliteration, though this may result in inconsistent
rendering of many words, including place-names and personal
names. The surname of the Greek-Catholic Metropolitan of Halych,
who came from a polonised Ruthenian family and accepted a
Ukrainian identity, will be transliterated in its Ukrainian form (i.e.,
"Sheptyts'kyi"), except in references to publications in languages
other than contemporary Ukrainian.
             A slightly modified Library of Congress transliteration
system will be used for Ruthenian or Ukrainian names of persons
and places.
      INTRODUCTION: SOCIETY, POLITICS AND
     THE CHURCH IN EASTERN GALICIA,1900-1939
        The changes in the educational and socio-economic status of
 the Greek-Catholic clergy in Eastern Galicia from 1900 to 1939, the
 development of its political and cultural attitudes and its sense of
 social role must be seen against the background of socio-economic,
 cultural and political developments in Galicia during this period. In
 this chapter, therefore, an attempt will be made to outline these
 developments under Austrian and Polish rule, insofar as they are
 relevant to the topic of this dissertation.
       The modern history of Western Ukraine, including that of
 Eastern Galicia, is generally treated in segments, with the Habsburg
 and Polish periods dealt with separately. Although the political
 changes occurring after the First World War In part justify such an
 approach, the broad socio-economic and cultural situation remained
to a great extent unchanged, representing a rough continuum over
the forty-year period with which this study is concerned. Indeed, even
the political changes were not as radical as might at first appear:
Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia had to deal with a Polish local
administration before 1918 as well as after. And although they could
no longer appeal for protection to an Emperor eager to control the
Polish autonomous movement, the forms of democratic government
did provide similar opportunities for pressing their case by appeals to
the national interest. Consequently, the Austrian and Polish periods
will not be dealt with separately in this chapter; instead, an outline of
the Ukrainians' socio-economic and cultural development and of
their political life spanning the period between 1900 and 1939 will be
provided.
       Although this is not the place for an analysis of over-all socio-
economic and cultural conditions in the Habsburg Empire or inter-
war Poland, it is important to keep in mind that whereas some of the
problems of Eastern Galicia were unique to that region, others were
typical of the entire state of which it was a part. Furthermore, it will
not be possible in this study to determine which conditions were the
results of state policy and which simply developed out of the existing
situation. Consequently, in describing socio-economic and cultural
conditions we shall not venture in every case to judge whether they
represented government policies, or to determine whether such
                                       14
policies were directed exclusively toward Eastern Galicia. Nor shall
we always seek to determine whether these policies were aimed at
the Ukrainians or the Poles alone. Rather, the object of this chapter is
to describe the context in which the Greek-Catholic clergy lived,
learned and worked, and in which they formed their attitudes about
contemporary issues and about their role in society.
       The survey of political developments will focus on the
Ruthenian (Ukrainian) national movement, in which the Greek-
Catholic clergy played a vital part. It is important to remember, of
course, that in twentieth-century Eastern Galicia there were in fact
two conflicting national movements. While in the Austrian period
the Ruthenian awakening followed in the footsteps of the Polish
independence movement, after 1918 Eastern Galicia saw the
inevitable conflict between a successful national movement that was
seeking to consolidate its newly-won statehood, and a frustrated one
in direct conflict with the former and claiming the same territory.

formed the context of its political expressions, in the last two decades
of Habsburg Austria and the following two decades of Polish rule?
       At the turn of the century Eastern Galicia was one of the
poorest places in Europe. 13 At the same time it was the "Piedmont of
Ukraine," where the cultural energies of the nation on either side of
the Russian border were concentrated. The tension contained in this
paradox may explain the remarkable political energy of the Galician
Ukrainians during the ensuing decades.
       For the peasants, who formed the overwhelming majority of
the population then known as Ruthenian, the principal socio-
economic problem was over-population. It was not simply a matter of
too many people, however, but rather of a high birth rate combined
with scarce available land and low agricultural productivity. Neither
the high death rate nor the heavy emigration (in 1911, over 14,200
peasants left for Canada, and as many for the United States) sufficed
to alleviate this problem and the attendant poverty. The constant

13     Galician poverty even figured as the title of Ignacy Daszyitski's 0 Ndzv
Galicvjskiej. Krakow, 1897.

division of land left a plethora of small holdings, many of which were
insufficient to support the families living on them. Furthermore,
there was a glaring contrast between large estates and "dwarf
holdings, while many peasants were altogether landless. Some 25
large landowners held about a fifth of the land. At the other end of the
scale, over 100,000 peasants, for example, found it necessary to
migrate to Germany as seasonal labourers in 1912-1913. 14
       At the same time, both government and private efforts were
made to alleviate the desperate conditions in Eastern Galicia. In the
wake of the massive and largely successful peasant strike of 1902,
over 180 estates were parcelled between 1902 and 1910. However, the
beneficiaries of the parcellation were generally Polish colonists
rather than the indigenous Ruthenians; similarly, central and local
state subsidies for drainage, flood control and such purposes tended
to go to Western rather than Eastern Galicia, and the predominantly
Polish local officials interfered with the Ruthenian peasants' private
efforts to improve conditions. 15
       Nevertheless, there were signs of improvement in the East
Galician economy. Petroleum fields discovered near Drohobych and
Boryslav promised considerable revenue and laid the foundations for
industrialisation. Between the 1870s and 1914 the budget of the
Galician Diet multiplied 30 times. A Provincial Bank was founded in
1883, a Bank of Industry in 1910. 16 Among the Ruthenian self-help
organisations, "Prosvita" ("Enlightenment"), founded in 1868,
published books on farming methods, sent out agronomists to lecture
on modern farming techniques, arranged for the sale of agricultural
tools at reduced prices, and established associations to provide small
loans at low interest. From 1898 "Sil's'kyi Hospodar" established
machinery stations, experimental farms and agricultural courses;
by 1912, it had 90 branches with 27,000 members. Credit unions,
numerous after 1898, provided cheap credit, though often on
condition of abstinence from alcohol (drink being considered a chief
cause of peasant indebtedness and hence poverty). Consumer

 cooperatives and cooperative land banks flourished in the
 countryside, while "Narodna Torhivlia" helped commerce in the
towns. A major dairy cooperative in Stryi was one of many such
producers' organisations belonging to the Provincial Audit Union.
From 1892 the "Dnister" association provided affordable insurance to
the Ruthenian masses. 17
       Strides were made in the social and cultural areas as well. The
improvement of education in Galicia in the late nineteenth century
had been primarily a Polish accomplishment, and served Polish
interests. In 1871 the Polish language was introduced in all state-
supported primary schools in the province. The Galician School
Board, though nominally under the Viceroy and the Ministry of
Education, became essentially a Galician institution, and established
secondary as well as primary schools and teachers' seminaries
(normal schools). However, as the peasants came to constitute a large
proportion of the pupils, the benefits of educational reform in Eastern
Galicia ifitered down to the Ruthenians. Thus, by 1914 almost half the
elementary schools, and a number of secondary and normal schools,
were Ruthenian in language of instruction. 18 In that year there
were 96 Polish state gymnasia and six Ruthenian ones. The
Emperor's demands for Ruthenian gymnasia were sometimes
refused by the Polish-dominated Galician Diet, for example, in the
case of a gymnasium in Stanyslaviv. Furthermore, it was
considerably more difficult for Ruthenians to be admitted to the state
gymnasia than for Poles, at least in Peremyshl' (Przemyl') and
Ternopil' (Tarnopol). Finally, the 2,457 Ruthenian elementary state
schools existing in 1910 were mostly one- or two-room affairs, often
with Polish teachers, while the 2,909 Polish schools generally had two
to eight rooms. 19 However, the Ruthenian intelligentsia did establish
fifteen private educational institutions and one private normal
school, all under the Land School Union in L'viv (Lemberg, Lw6w).
In higher education, there were seven full professorships and four
lectureships in Ruthenian studies at the University of L'viv by 1914. 20
       Adult education flourished too, under the aegis of "Prosvita,"
which organised reading rooms throughout the province. In 1912,

"Prosvita" had 74 branches, 2,611 reading rooms, and over 130,000
members and had published 445 books in over three million copies.
The Shevchenko Scientific Society, founded in 1873 and re-organised
in the 1890s, and financed largely by wealthy Ukrainians from the
Russian Empire, became a sort of Academy of Sciences for the
Ruthenians and their Ukrainian compatriots.21
        Ruthenian life in Eastern Galicia also benefited from the
flourishing of theatrical and musical groups. Athletic organisations
like the nationalist "Sokil" (1898) and the socialist "Sich" (1900), with
866 and 794 members, respectively, in 1912, propagated the new
Ukrainian consciousness among the Ruthenians and contributed to
the future military and political leadership of the nation. 22
              The demographic picture of Galicia justified the view
that its Easterm and Western parts were fairly distinct. Of the entire
province, which had a population of 7,908,504 in 1897, 3,080,443 were
Ruthenian speaking in 1900 and 3,109,127 were Greek-Uniate by
religion in that year; 23 out of a total of eight million in 1910, 4,670,000
were Poles and 3,200,000 Ruthenians. 24 However, in Eastern Galicia
out of a population of 4,814,171 in 1900, Greek-Catholics constituted
3,022,929 while Latin-rite Catholics amounted to 1,131,330. 25 Although
religious denomination is not a perfect indicator of nationality --
there were Greek-Catholic Poles as well as Latin-rite Catholic
Ruthenians (though these were frequently regarded by their co-
nationals as victims of assimilation) -- these latter figures give a
rough idea of the relative proportions of Ruthenians and Poles in
Eastern Galicia. In Western Galicia, by contrast, the Ruthenians
tended to be linguistically polonised, except in the mountainous
Lemko region in the south.
       After World War I and the fall of Austria-Hungary, the
traditional socio-economic and cultural problems of Galicia were
compounded by the difficulties faced by the new Polish state. For the
Ruthenians -- who after their war of independence of 19 18-1920
generally regarded themselves as part of the greater Ukrainian

nation -- there were added the difficulties of rebuilding their life in
the confines of an often hostile national state.
        Many of Poland's economic problems were characteristic of
those of inter-war Eastern Europe. In agriculture, the persistence of
strip farming and the large number of dwarf holdings (5 hectares or
less), complicated by the continuing subdivision of landholdings
among the sons of a family, retarded progress. Competition from
American grain and, from about 1930, the effects of the Depression
(especially the dramatic fall in the price of wheat on home markets),
aggravated the situation. The disparity between the prices of
industrial goods (such as ploughs), which remained fairly high, and
the falling prices of agricultural goods -- the notorious "price
scissors" -- contributed to the impoverishment of the peasantry. Only
in the last few years before the outbreak of World War II did a limited
agricultural recovery take place.26
       Poland also had to repair the devastation of the World War,
much of which had been fought on what was now her territory.
Agriculture had been particularly hard hit. There was the added
difficulty of integrating the formerly Prussian, Russian and
Austrian lands with their varying systems of communication,
transportation, and education, as well as their disparate economic
orientations. Inflation was very high in the first five years of
independence. Unemployment was rife. The country was
underindustrialised, and little foreign investment in Polish industry
ever materialised. Despite large-scale projects like Gdynia and the
Central Industrial Region, industrialisation developed too slowly.
Growing economic nationalism abroad obstructed Poland's foreign
trade as world agricultural surpluses depressed prices and hindered
her exports. Trade barriers prohibited Poland from obtaining the
foreign exchange she needed to buy imports required for
industrialisation. Meanwhile, the country's standard of living slowly
declined. Land reform, with its attendant parcellation of large
estates, never went far enough, and immigration -- restricted by the

United States in the 1920s and by other states during the Depression -
- never sufficed to relieve the overpopulation of the countryside.27
        The state of Poland's agriculture was of particular relevance to
the Ukrainians of Galicia, including the Greek-Catholic clergy. The
overwhelming majority of the population -- for example, 81.3% in
Ternopil county -- were engaged in farming. 28 Overpopulation of the
countryside remained acute, and emigration (about 578,000 in
Eastern Galicia in 1919-1925, about 964,000 in 1926-1930) did not
relieve it here any more than elsewhere in Poland; furthermore,
about half the emigrants returned.29
        Also among the problems facing Polish agriculture as a whole
were a lack of capital, primitive techniques, and the land ownership
system. The agricultural yield of wheat in Poland was less than that
of fifteen other European countries in the 1930s. In 1921, 33.9% of the
landholdings were of two hectares or less; another 30.7% were of
between two and five hectares. Together, these constituted 15.3% of
the area under cultivation. Yet five hectares was considered to be the
minimum amount of land needed to support a family. Four million
peasants had no land at all. At the same time, a mere 0.6% of the
holdings, consisting of estates of over a hundred hectares, accounted
for 43% of the land being cultivated. This concentration of ownership
was probably greater than that of any other European country except
Hungary. 30
        In the inter-war period commassation of landholdings, an
antidote to wasteful strip farming, was carried out. By 1938, over 40%
of the land involved in the program had been commas sed. 31
        The most ambitious reform, however, was the Land Reform
aimounced by a resolution of Parliament in July 1919, and voted into
law in July 1920 under the pressure of the Bolshevik advance, but not
put into effect until the law of 1925 established agrarian offices to
carry it out. Under the reform in its final version, the state would pay
for half the value of an owner's land subject to the reform in cash,

 and half in government bonds. The beneficiary would pay five percent
 down with forty-one years to pay off the rest, financing to be provided
 by the State Land Bank. In addition to private holdings, land of the
 State, the Catholic Church (under the 1925 Concordat) and other
 public institutions was subject to state purchase. (The parcellation of
 Church lands will be discussed in Chapter Three.) General
 landholders could retain holdings of no more than 180 hectares;
 however, the limit in suburban and industrial areas was 60 hectares,
 and in the East, where the landowners were usually Polish and the
 beneficiaries of parcellation would have been Belorussians or
 Ukrainians, the limit was 300 hectares. 32
         The land reform, once it was under way, accommodated only
 about a third of the increase of the rural population, with some
 130,000 hectares distributed each year. Moreover, the financial
 obligations incurred by the recipients of land proved heavy. Worse
 still, the average size of small holdings decreased steadily. The
reform was slowed up after Pilsudski's 1926 coup and his
rapprochement with the conservatives, but sped up again under the
Kocia1kowski government in 1935. The greatest progress was in the
eastern and central provinces. However, many landowners took
advantage of the provision of the reform act allowing the owner to
dispose of the land subject to the reform within twelve months of
publication of the notice of expropriation. There was a tendency to
dispose of the inferior part of a holding, and often the purchaser was
a well-to-do peasant rather than a landless peasant or small-holder.
         Nevertheless, by 1938 the reform was two-thirds complete, and
the decrease in the number of large estates as well as dwarf holdings
testified to a levelling process -- though this did not relieve the
growing pressure of population on the land. 34 In 1939, there were still
two million farms --over half the peasant holdings -- that were not
large enough to maintain the cultivators at subsistence. On the other
hand, estates of over 50 hectares, owned by fewer than 30,000
individuals, constituted about 24% of the total area under cultivation
in Poland.

       From the point of view of the Ukrainian peasants of Galicia,
the reform was not necessarily a good thing. Aside from the
discriminatory differential in the maximum permissible size of
holdings favouring the Polish landowners, there was the fact that the
parcelled lands frequently went to Polish colonists from other
provinces rather than to local Ukrainians. At the same time, the
Ukrainian farm workers employed on large estates that were
parcelled lost their jobs. 36
       However, Stanislaw Skrzypek points out that the state
guaranteed the Ukrainians at least an equal share of the parcelled
lands in spite of the fact that the estates belonged mainly to Poles
(thus evidently assuming that the Ukrainians would not normally be
entitled to land parcelled out from Polish-held estates). He cites a
figure of 872,000 acres parcelled in Eastern Galicia between 1919 and
1938, of which 495,000 went th Ukrainians.
       Agriculture was no less immune to the ravages of the
Depression than the rest of the Polish economy. The harbinger of
depression was the fall of world timber prices with the reappearance
of Russia on the world market in 1928. Wheat prices fell in the
autunm of 1929 with the over-production of wheat in America and
continued to fall in the following years, bringing down the prices of
other raw agricultural products, on which the balance of trade of
most East European countries depended. However, this disaster for
the small farmer did less harm to the seasonal labourer (so common
among the Ukrainians of Eastern Galicia) working on large estates,
as he was usually paid in kind, with a percentage of the crop he had
harvested. 38
                One effect in Eastern Europe of the international
depression was an increasing economic self-reliance, which
contributed to political nationalism and undermined internationalist
tendencies among the working class. Discontent arose among the
older civil servants, victims of cost cuts, and the army officers, as well
as among the recent university graduates who could not find work.
In the countryside, the owner-farmers (rather than the labourers)
most resented the high industrial prices and interest rates. In

 Poland as elsewhere in Eastern Europe, in view of the heavy Jewish
 representation in banking and industry, such feelings were easily
 translated into anti-Semitism. The scarcity of jobs exacerbated inter-
 ethnic tensions in general. Throughout Eastern Europe, the position
 of national minorities began to deteriorate.39
               Poland seemed to be faced with intractable problems.
 Broad economic discontent surfaced in the general strike of
 November 1923, the industrial strikes of 1936, and the agricultural
 strike of August 1937. Even the most energetic reforms could not
 solve the country's difficulties. Although the judgment of Samuel
 Sharp, describing the government's programmes as
 "bureaucratically inspired economic activity of a kind which evoked
 sneering comments from a diffident population," may be harsh, one
 must agree with his evaluation that "after twenty years the gap
between needs and achievements was not sufficiently narrowed in
terms of many things that mattered." 40
        There were, of course, private efforts to deal creatively with
these economic problems, not least among the Ukrainians of Galicia
 (or, as it was then officially known, Eastern Little Poland). To an
 extent this was a matter of reviving and developing the institutions
that they had organised under Austrian rule. Although Raymond
Leslie Buefl, writing in the 1930s, concluded that the cooperative
could not meet Poland's economic needs, particularly in Eastern
Poland where the peasants were illiterate, 41 the Ukrainian
cooperative movement forged ahead under Polish rule. This was in
great part the work of veterans of the Ukrainian Galician Army who
had studied in Czechoslovakia and returned to Galicia in the mid-
 1920s to re-open and expand the cooperatives closed or destroyed
between 1914 and 1923.
        In 1923 there were 830 Ukrainian consumer cooperatives in
Galicia. Retail cooperatives were organised under "Tsentrosoiuz,"
while the dairy cooperative "Maslosoiuz" came to produce a fifth of
Poland's butter exports. Credit and savings cooperatives arose as
well. By 1935 these various institutions, organised in the Audit Union
of Ukrainian Cooperatives, claimed over 542,000 members; two years
later they had 661,000. By 1935 they had created 12,500 jobs. Also of aid

to the farmers were the Agrarian Mortgage Bank and the
organisation "Silskyi Hospodar," continued from Austrian times,
which in 1936 had 63 branches and 107,200 members -- an enormous
increase in membership over the 27,000 claimed in 1912. The
"Dnister" insurance association was restored as well. 42 According to
some Ukrainian sources, the Ukrainian cooperatives received no aid
from the Polish government, though a Polish source disagrees. In
any case, the cooperatives did raise the peasants' economic status --
and with it their national consciousness.
        The Ukrainians of Eastern Galicia suffered social-cultural as
well as economic difficulties in inter-war Poland. Employment was
often contingent on converting from the Greek to the Latin Catholic
rite. 45 Of the 600 workmen at the Polonia petroleum refinery, only ten
were Ukrainians, and these were reportedly pressured to avoid
joining any Ukrainian party or organisation. 46 In their search for
jobs, the young intelligentsia were hampered both by general
conditions of unemployment in Poland and by national
discrimination, particularly in government and education.
Ukrainian judges were removed or transferred to ethnically Polish
areas. The local administration was overwhelmingly Polish. Polish
colonists (often ex-servicemen), settled in Eastern Galicia after 1919,
competed for land and jobs. In 1939 the Ukrainian politician Vasyl'
Paneiko asserted that the Poles had monopolised public employment,
hindered instruction in the Ukrainian language, established a
numerus clausus in higher education, and taken measures against
the Ukrainian cooperatives. Indeed, of the 120 to 140 students
admitted to the medical school at the University of L'viv there were
only two Ukrainians in 1931, nine in 1932, six in 1933, and ten in each
of the two following years. Whereas twelve subjects had been taught

at that university before World War I, under Polish rule all courses
were taught in Polish. ''
       Education was a serious problem throughout Poland,
especially in the rural areas; the ethnic problem, pronounced in the
Galician countryside, complicated it further. As against a national
average of 32.7% illiteracy among persons over ten years of age, the
rate of illiteracy was 38.7% in Ternopil' county and 40.4% in
Stanyslaviv county in 1921. By the late 1930s, however, these figures
had fallen to 29.8% and 36.6%, respectively.48 The Austrian system of
separate Polish and Ukrainian schools was abandoned, and under
the 1924 school law (the "1. Grabski") the mixed Polish-Ukrainian
"utraquistic" school was introduced, with courses in both Polish and
Ukrainian (though even the latter were frequently taught by Poles).
Thus, the number of schools with Ukrainian as the principal
language of instruction dropped from 2,417 in 1924 to 457 in the late
1930s; the number of bi-lingual schools, on the other hand, reached
2,230. 49 There were 452 Ukrainian-language elementary schools in
1938, and 2,485 utraquistic schools. However, in that year there were
21 secondary schools with Ukrainian as the language of instruction,
and only two bilingual ones; there were 19 Ukrainian lycees and two
bilingual lycees. 50 The "Ridna Shkola" society was founded to
provide private schooling in the Ukrainian language. In 1938 it had
107, 332 members and maintained 33 elementary schools. 51
       In higher education, the five-year course of the Greek-Catholic
Theological Academy established in L'viv in 1928 provided the
equivalent of university education, while Ukrainian professors
taught at L'viv, Cracow and Warsaw Universities. In 1930 the Polish
government set up a Ukrainian Scientific Institute in Warsaw. The
issue of a Ukrainian university, however, was never settled; the
government proposed that such an institution should be situated in
Cracow while the Ukrainians insisted on L'viv. Between 1921 and
1926 an underground Ukrainian university functioned in L'viv with
1,500 students. 52 Adult education continued to be provided by

"Prosvita," now under the influence of the Ukrainian National
Democratic Union (UNDO). It grew from a membership of 6,900 in
 1925 to 31,100 ten years later, and operated 3,017 reading rooms in
 1935 (as compared with 2,376 in 1910), with 295 "central" reading
rooms in that year (114 in 1910).
        The publication of Ukrainian-language newspapers and other
periodicals in Galicia rose from around 72 before 1910 to 129 in 1926,
including 28 political, some 16 religious, and 19 cultural, literary and
scholarly publications. By 1937 the Ukrainian religious press alone
counted 20 titles on Ukrainian lands in Poland, including 12 Greek-
Catholic titles in Eastern Galicia.
        Social organisations were likewise revived after World War I.
The "Sokil" athletic organisation, now affiliated with UNDO, claimed
8,000 members with 508 branches in 1930. "Sich" was reorganised as
"Luh," still under Socialist-Radical influence, though in 1926 some
branches allied themselves with the nationalist camp. In 1929 "Luh"
had over 700 branches. The youth organisation "Plast" was
prohibited in 1930, however. The Union of Ukrainian Women grew
from 25,000 members in 1935 to 45,000 in 1937.
       Albeit in different proportions, both Poles and Ukrainians in
Galicia had their intellectuals, merchants, peasants and industrial
workers. Each social group experienced contact, and conflict, with
the corresponding group of the other nation. The Ukrainian
bourgeoisie numbered about 10,000 in Poland. The "petite
bourgeoisie" constituted only about 2.5% of Ukrainian society but was
growing, due to the entry of Ukrainians into small trade. The
intelligentsia consisted mostly of priests, teachers and managers of
cooperatives rather than lawyers, physicians or journalists. 58 The
inter-war period was marked by Ukrainian migration from country
to city and by the rise of a village intelligentsia.

and Western European cultural currents, can only be hinted at here.
In 1900, Western Ukrainian literature was leaving behind the folk
ways of the village and aspiring to Western urban cultural models.
By 1939, a strong sense of membership in the European cultural
community had emerged. Folk tradition continued to inspire the
plastic arts, music and literature, but no longer monopolised their
style or content.
       The role of the Greek-Catholic Church in Eastern Galician
society will be discussed in detail in subsequent chapters. Here it
should suffice to quote two observations, the first by Raymond Leslie
Buell (1939), the second by Stanisaw Skrzypek (1948):
              Although the Uniat Church was originally
           created to win over the Ukrainians to Poland, it
           now serves as a national church, playing a role
           not unlike that played by the Catholic Church
           with respect to Polish nationalism during the
           nineteenth century. 60
                 the Greek Catholic had the characteristics
           of a national Ukrainian church. It had
           enormous influence a m o n g t h e
           Ukrainian people and was a pillar of
           moderation and common sense in various
           periods of tension in Polish-Ukrainian
           relations. 61

       During the period under study, the demographic picture did
not change radically, apart from the effects of overpopulation and
emigration mentioned above. In 1921, Ukrainians made up about 14%
of the population of Poland; estimates of their number have ranged
from three million (and a census figure of 3,898,431) to ten million.
For 1931, some Polish sources cited a figure of 4.8 million, though the
census figure was only 3,227,000 or 10.1% of the population, while
some Ukrainians claimed to number six or seven million. 62 In
Eastern Galicia, "Ukrainians and Rusyns" constituted 52.3% of the
population in 1931 (Greek-Catholics and Orthodox together coming to

58.3%), while Poles made up 41.7% (with 30.6% Roman Catholics).63
In the late 1930s, the number of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia was
about 3,500,000, with the vast majority in the countryside. (The towns
were mostly Polish and Jewish.) 64 In 1931 the number of Greek-
Catholics was 3,336,200 according to the census. 65 By 1939, a
Ukrainian ethnographer found that Ukrainians made up 64.2% of
the Eastern Galician population, Poles 16%, and latvnnvky (Latin-rite
Catholics of Ukrainian ethnic origin) 8.8%. 66 While some of the
estimates indicate a decline in the number of Ukrainians in the
region, it is difficult to determine whether this may not have been the
result of census methods; it is also possible that there was a good deal
of ethnic assimilation, aided by transfers of Catholics to the Latin
from the Greek rite.
       The economic, social and cultural difficulties faced by
Ruthenians under Austria continued into the Polish period,
aggravated by the specific difficulties of reborn Poland. Yet the
private initiatives of this group as it grew in its Ukrainian
consciousness overcame many of these problems. These efforts were
closely connected with, and inspired by, political currents.

2. Political Lit

       While the socio-economic and cultural life of the Ruthenians
(Ukrainians) in Eastern Galicia formed a rough continuum over the
final years of Austrian rule and the period of the Second Polish
Republic, political life, not surprisingly, changed its course
somewhat after 1918. This was due to a combination of new political
circumstances on the one hand, and trends that had been developing
in the province over the past several decades on the other.
       In the 1930s Raymond Leslie Buell observed that "what the
Polish problem was in the nineteenth century, the Ukrainian
problem may become in the twentieth." 67 In the period from 1900 to
1939, these two rising nationalisms, both claiming the same territory,
clashed, first in the multinational political arena of the Austrian

Empire, then more openly when the one found its embodiment in a
national state frustrating the ambitions of the other.
      From the 1870s the Galician Poles, first represented by the
landowning szlachta and later by the middle class, sought greater
provincial autonomy by participating actively in government. They
also made great strides in "organic work," improving the economic,
educational and cultural level of the province. The provincial statute
of 1867 and the polonisation of education and local government made
Galicia a focus of Polish life in the Partition period. Poles attained
high positions in the provincial as well as the central imperial
administrations. 68
      Austrian policy turned from favouring the Ruthenian revival
to indulging Polish demands in Galicia. However, the Vienna
government continued to see the Ruthenians of Ukrainian
orientation as a counterweight to Polish influence. Foreign policy
considerations also prompted Vienna to favour the Ukrainophiles,
who opposed Russia, and to counteract the Russophile "Old
Ruthenians."
      The conservative Poles, on the other hand, supported the Old
Ruthenians, if only because they were a split in the Ruthenian camp.
Besides, the Old Ruthenians, who were particularly strong among
the Greek-Catholic clergy, represented a socially conservative force,
while the Ukrainophile populists tended to be socially radical if not
outright socialists.69
      The Old Ruthenians were organised in the Rada Rus'ka
(Ruthenian Council) formed in 1870, the Populists in the Narodna
Rada (People's or National Council) of 1885. Radicalism had suffered
a temporary eclipse as some conservative clerics made their
influence felt in the Populist movement, but returned in the 1880s
and later as a Populist faction. 70
      The Ruthenians (who began to identify themselves as
Ukrainians around the turn of the century) entered Austrian politics
in an organised manner in the late 1870s, shortly after the Poles.

 However, they had little success in the elections. In the 1890s a
 number of new political parties were formed: the Ukrainian Radical
 Party (1890), the Ukrainian Social-Christian Party (1896), the
 Ukrainian Social-Democratic Party (a split-off from the
 Radicals)(1896), and the Ukrainian National Democratic Party
 (including a number of former Radicals and Populists)(1899).
        The growth of the Ukrainophile tendency in Ruthenian
 populism was aided by the influx of Ukrainian intelligentsia from
 the Russian Empire, especially after the 1876 Ems ukase severely
 restricting publishing in the Ukrainian language. L'viv became the
 centre of Ukrainian political as well as cultural activity. The socialist
historian Mykhailo Hrushevs'kyi, who held the chair of Ukrainian
history at the University of L'viv, and the radical socialist
theoretician Mykhailo Drahomanov, who maintained contacts with
the Galician intelligentsia from Swiss exile, exerted great influence
on the Populists. Although there was sometimes friction between the
socially radical Eastern Ukrainians and the conservative Galicians --
the Kaisertreu "Tyroleans of the East" -- they agreed on a broad
populist platform, opposed Polish hegemony, and led the Ruthenian-
Ukrainian revival. As the Russophiles, who had begun the
Ruthenian revival decades earlier, lost influence, a new breed of
populist intellectuals -- teachers, scholars and lawyers, often from
priestly families -- took the lead. They agitated for the division of
Galicia into East and West and for national autonomy for Ukrainians
within the Empire. Some, notably the Radicals, pressed for full
Ukrainian independence in union with a free Eastern Ukraine,
though for many this was only an ultimate goal to be subordinated
for the moment to more moderate demands. The title of Iuliian
Bachyns'kyi's Ukrain p Irredenta (1897) speaks for itself. At the same
time, some moderate Populists sought a compromise with the Poles:
in the 1890s the "New Era" movement under Iuliian Romanchuk
negotiated with some success with the Galician Viceroy Count
Badeni. There were also appeals to the highest government levels,
though Emperor Franz Josef s notorious dismissal of a Ruthenian
delegation in 1895 dampened such hopes. In any case, mounting
Polish success in the capital obstructed Ukrainian efforts. Such
disappointments, together with a deteriorating economic situation in
the 1890s, favoured the Radicals. When in 1899 the moderate Radical
                                    30
wing joined with the Populists to form the National Democratic
Party, the new formation's platform of Ukrainian unification and
land reform made it the most broadly based and influential
Ukrainian movement of the next four decades. With the decline of the
Old Ruthenians, it also became the favoured political movement of
the Greek-Catholic clergy. 71 (This development will be discussed in
Chapter Six.)
       The growth of Ukrainian nationalism inevitably conflicted
with the already entrenched interests of the Galician Poles. The
notion of co-existence among Poles, Ruthenians and Galicia's other
nationalities -- if it ever commanded much support -- quickly lost
ground. 72 Professor Estreicher asserts that "all Polish parties and
all the Polish statesmen who ruled Galicia stood by the principle that
the Ruthenes must be allowed to develop their nationality and use
their language in office and in schools," and blames the breakdown
in cooperation on the Ruthenians' low cultural level, their lack of
educated men, and their primitive political approach. Certainly the
Populists' demand for the partition of Galicia meant the
transformation of the eastern half into a Ukrainian land. But this
was hardly more extreme than the notion of Eastern Galicia as part
of a Polish land, long the position of the "Podolian" landowners who
would not countenance co-existence with the Ruthenians on
anything like equal terms. Meanwhile, the rise of the Polish National
Democrats from 1900 boded ill for Ruthenian-Ukrainian autonomy.
       One focus of the Polish-Ukrainian struggle was the question of
electoral reform. The Poles generally favoured provincial autonomy
on the basis of the curial system of indirect representation, which
worked to their advantage inasmuch as they controlled most of the
curiae. The Ukrainians, a numerical majority in the eastern part of
the province, favoured the most direct representation. In this they
enjoyed the support of the Polish left. There were also allegations of
electoral corruption, while the "bloody" elections of 1897 left a painful
memory. The introduction of universal suffrage through direct
voting for parliamentary elections in 1907 raised the question of
electoral reform for the Galician Diet. Viceroy Potocki's support of
the Russophile Old Ruthenians prompted his assassination by

Myroslav Sichyns'kyi, a Ukrainophile, in April 1908. His successor,
MichaI Bobrzyiski, sought electoral reform and a Polish-Ruthenian
settlement. His support of the Ukrainian Populists and his opposition
to the Russophiles ran afoul of local Polish opinion, and it was finally
the opposition of the Roman Catholic hierarchy to his reform that led
to his resignation in 1913. It was only under his successor, Witold
Korytowski, that a complex plan for electoral reform was adopted, in
January 1914. It was also agreed that a Ukrainian university would
be founded.
       About this time, Polish opinion began to tend away from
Austria and towards Russia, reinforced in this by reports of German
support for the Ukrainians. Aside from the Russophiles, who
expected a Russian victory in a future war and hoped that a
victorious Russia would grant them autonomy, the Ukrainians
remained firmly loyal to the Habsburgs. Indeed, even some of the
Russophiles became disillusioned when the Russian occupation
authorities who ruled Galicia in the first year of the World War
proved insensitive to their aspirations (see Chapter Six). Meanwhile,
Ukrainian politicians continued to press for the creation of a
separate Eastern Galician crownland, to be joined by Bukovyna and
Transcarpathia. '
       With the outbreak of war in 1914 the Ukrainian political
parties formed the Supreme Ukrainian Council under the National
Democrat Konstantyn Levyts'kyi and declared their support for
Austria-Hungary. In 1915 this group was reorganised as the General
Ukrainian Council.
       Throughout the war the Poles and Ukrainians vied with each
other to win advantages and support for their aims from the Central
Powers. Pi1sudski's Galician legions had their counterpart in the
Ukrainian Sich Sharpshooters formed in 1914. The Central Powers'
proclamation of a Kingdom of Poland (to include Eastern Galicia) in
1916 was a setback for the Ukrainians; the Central Powers'
agreement of 8 February 1918 with the Ukrainians at Brest-Litovsk,
giving them Kholm (Chehn) and promising a Ukrainian province,
was a blow to the Poles.

      When a Polish state arose upon the ruins of Austria and
Germany in November 1918, its first armed struggle was with the
Ukrainians. The latter had decided at a meeting of political leaders
the previous month to form a Ukrainian National Council and
proclaim an independent Western Ukrainian Popular Republic
(ZUNR). In the early morning hours of November 1 they took over
L'viv. Thus began the Polish-Ukrainian war over Eastern Galicia,
which continued into 1919. In January 1919 the ZUNR joined with the
Ukrainian Popular Republic (UNR). Meanwhile, the Paris Peace
Conference sought a compromise between the two sides, but the new
Polish government pursued its aims in Eastern Galicia on both the
military and diplomatic fronts. Finally, fear of a Bolshevik advance
moved the Allies to sanction Polish control to the Zbruch on 25 June
1919. In July the forces of the ZUNR were pushed eastward across
the Zbruch onto territory held by the UNR. In November the Supreme
Allied Council adopted a statute for Eastern Galicia, providing for
broad autonomy under Polish administration for twenty-five years.
However, the Poles rejected this plan.
      The politically active Western Ukrainians generally remained
loyal to the dictator of the ZUNR, Ievhen Petrushevych, who
established himself in Vienna and firmly opposed all Polish
pretensions to Eastern Galicia. However, in the autunm of 1919 the
chief of the Directorate of the UNB, Symon Petliura, entered into
secret negotiations with the Polish government. In April 1920 a
military agreement was signed in Warsaw by which the UNIt gave
up Eastern Galicia to Poland in exchange for military assistance in a
campaign against the Bolsheviks in Ukraine. The successful joint
operations of Pilsudski and Petliura culminated in the taking of Kiev
in May 1920, but the Bolshevik advance that began in June nearly
reached the gates of Warsaw in August. By November 1920 the
Ukrainian forces were out of the action, and control of Ukrainian
lands became a question of the relative military and diplomatic
strengths of Poland and Soviet Russia. The Treaty of Riga of March
1921 left Western Ukraine (including Eastern Galicia) to Poland.76
      Already in that year a secret Ukrainian Military Organisation
(UVO) was formed to carry on a struggle against Polish rule. An
attempt was made to assassinate Pilsudski in L'viv, and in 1922 the

Polish governor Grabowski was murdered in protest against the
introduction of the name MaIopolska Wschodnia ("Eastern Little
Poland") for the province. Ukrainian political parties boycotted that
year's parliamentary elections on the ground that Polish rule over
Eastern Galicia was illegitimate. In the meantime, intense lobbying
by Polish and Ukrainian representatives continued on the diplomatic
front. In September 1922 the Sejm passed a law on autonomy for the
counties of L'viv, Ternopil' and Stanyslaviv, in an apparent effort to
conciliate the Allies as well as the Ukrainians. On 14 March of the
following year the Council of Ambassadors recognised the inclusion
of Eastern Galicia in the Polish frontiers. Although autonomy for the
three counties was not made an explicit condition, the autonomy
statute as well as Polish accession to the 1919 Treaty on the Protection
of Minorities were referred to in the decision. The provisions for
autonomy were never carried out, however, and Poland repudiated
the Treaty in 1934.
       The Polish state as it existed between its formation in 1918 and
Pi]sudski's take-over in May 1926 has been described as an
incomplete democracy, and as an incomplete dictatorship from 1926
to 1939. 78 Although it was the socialist Pilsudski whose provisional
government became the basis for the new regime, it was the right-
wing, middle-class National Democrats ("Endeky") of Roman
Dmowski that dominated the first Sejm elected in 1919. Yet the
political and ideological differences between the two camps soon
became blurred, though hostility persisted. Both camps were strongly
nationalistic; even the majority of the Polish socialists who formed
the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) were highly patriotic, as was the
"Piast" peasant movement led by Wincenty Witos. In a country where
70% of the population was dependent on agriculture, the peasant
parties should have been very important. However, they never really
ruled, though they were a considerable factor in elections. They
tended to represent only the wealthier peasants, and in Galicia were
anti-socialist, but otherwise had no clear programme. Some of their
leaders engaged in a good deal of corrupt and opportunistic political

maneuvering. ' Nevertheless, it was a member of Witos' party,
Wojciechowski, who replaced the assassinated victor of the 1922
elections, Narutowicz, and it was a Witos government that was
ejected by PilsudsU's 1926 coup.
       In a country in which national minorities made up
approximately a third of the population, and which was surrounded
by hostile neighbours likely to exploit any irredentist tendencies, it
was natural that nationalities policy should have been high on the
agenda. The constitution of 1921 gave national minorities basic
organisational, linguistic and religious rights, thus implementing
the minorities treaty accepted by Poland in 1919. Three laws
introduced by the minister Grabski and ratified by the Sejm in July
1924 established minority linguistic rights in the administration,
schools and courts (though some Ukrainian leaders considered these
laws restrictive). Generally, the left supported the national
minorities, while the right took a more guarded stance, suspecting
their loyalty to the state. The Socialist Party proposed territorial
autonomy for non-Polish districts, opposing the Endek policy of
polonisation. 80
       When JOzef Pilsudski seized power in 1926 he led a curious
coalition of his own legionaries, the Army, and the left. Soon,
however, he abandoned socialism and sought out the cooperation of
industrialists and large landowners. The powers of the Sejm were
restricted, and a Non-party Block of Cooperation with the
Government (BBWR) was created in order to de-politicise public life
and mobilise support for a government faced with a deluge of
intractable problems. The Block won a plurality in the 1928 elections.
Terror and arrests accompanied the elections of 1930, Witos escaped
to Czechoslovakia, the BBWR gained a large majority in the Sejm,
and the state was centralised. The new authoritarian measures were
enshrined in the constitution enacted shortly before Pilsudski's death
in May of 1935. 81

continuation of the National Democratic Party . It sought to
reconstruct Ukrainian life in the framework of the Polish state.
Competing successfully with the Socialist Radicals and the Social
Democrats, this party became the Ukrainian National Democratic
Union (UNDO) in 1925. It had three wings: a left (which seceded in
1927 to form a new Labour Party), a centre (supporting an
independent Ukrainian democratic state and radical land reform),
and a right wing (some of the members of which later joined those
centrists who supported a policy of "realism" vis a vis the Polish
government. The majority joined the centre. Basically Christian in
outlook, UNDO found itself in a quandary inasmuch as its advocacy
of land reform seemed to pit it against the Greek-Catholic Church, a
major landowner in Eastern Galicia. UNDO was supported chiefly by
the Ukrainian intelligentsia, bourgeoisie, many of the farmers and
the Greek-Catholic clergy. 82
        At the same time Galicia, once the centre of Polish
conservatism and now a focus of the peasant movement, had become
the most radical part of Poland. Though there was probably little
sympathy for Communism, revolutionary sentiments grew. 83
Among the Ukrainians of Eastern Galicia, nearly all of whom had
abandoned the designation "Ruthenian" (rus yn, Polish rusin) by the
1920s (and resented Polish use of this term), there was some initial
pro-Bolshevik sentiment inspired by reports of Soviet Ukrainisation.
In UNDO such tendencies faded in the late 1920s, however, and were
altogether dispelled by news of the Soviet terror, collectivisation and
famine of 1929-1933. Although the Communist Party of Western
Ukraine (KPZU) formed a Ukrainian Peasants' and Workers' Union
("Selrob") in 1926, this lost popularity and disappeared with the Soviet
liquidation of the KPZU in 1938. Dissolved after Communist
infiltration, the Social Democratic Party was renewed in 1929. While
the Right had disappeared from the Ukrainian political scene with
the dissolution of the Ukrainian Christian Social Party in 1923, the
formation in 1930 of a Ukrainian Catholic People's Party temporarily
filled this gap. UNDO, the Socialist Radicals, and the pro-Communist
parties participated in the elections of 1928. 84

       illegal political groups like the UVO continued their activities.
In 1924 there was an attempted assassination of President
Wojciechowski. The Polish school superintendent Sobii%ski was killed
in L'viv in 1926. In 1929 the conspiratorial Organisation of Ukrainian
Nationalists (OUN) was formed in Vienna, and undertook operations
in Poland with German financial support. The colonisation of
"Eastern Little Poland" provided a pretext for OUN bombings,
sabotage, and the burning of estates. This in turn provoked the
pacification of September-October 1930. On the pretext that some
Ukrainians had harboured terrorists, police and cavalry units
assaulted farmers and their families, wrecked private households
and cooperatives, and arrested a number of priests and even
members of parliament. There were deaths as well. Both Polish and
foreign opinion denounced the pacification as disproportionate to any
threat to the state. The matter was referred to the League of Nations,
which finally reported that Poland did not persecute her minorities
and that although some individuals had been overly zealous in
carrying out their duties, those had been punished.
       Meanwhile, the legal Ukrainian parties dissociated
themselves from the activities of the UVO and OUN. However,
UNDO's criticism -- after initial silence -- of the OUN had not been
sufficiently unequivocal to satisfy all of Polish opinion, and its praise
of the OUN's "idealism" was later cited as evidence of the need for
the pacification. 85 UNDO itself suffered a right-wing split when
Dmytro Paliiv formed the Front of National Unity in 1933.
       The League of Nations' exoneration of the Polish government
in January 1932 made approving reference to a speech of 16 January
by Interior Minister Bronisaw Pieracki, who had announced that
the government's minorities policy sought to create "rational bases
for the harmonious dwelling together of all citizens, with the same
rights and privileges," but criticising those Ukrainians who had
sought to infringe the rights of Poles being settled in Eastern Galicia.
86
      The terrorism continued. Tadeusz Ho16wko, a champion of
Polish-Ukrainian cooperation, was killed in 1931. On 15 June 1934
Broths1aw Pieracki was assassinated in Warsaw by an OUN activist

who succeeded in fleeing the country. Pilsudski, a personal friend of
the victim, issued an order for the detainment in non-penal
institutions of persons suspected of threatening state security and
public order. Thus were founded the concentration camps at Bereza
Kartuska and Biala, where many OUN activists were confined.
       In the same year, German support for the OUN was
terminated under the Polish-German agreement. The continued
vitality of the organisation showed, however, that far from being the
creature of German military circles, it enjoyed considerable popular
sympathy.
       Unlike UNDO, the OUN did not carry on practical politics in
the normal sense. Under the inspiration of Dmytro Dontsov (an
Eastern Ukrainian of landowning origins), it developed an ideology
in which politics became a matter of unchangeable principles and
moral absolutes rather than pragmatism and compromise. The
Nationalists rejected rationality for idealism, mysticism and
voluntarism. Thus, much of their activity made little political sense.
Their ideology was a kind of secular theology; it is perhaps
significant that some prominent OUN leaders were sons of Greek-
Catholic priests. The spiritualisation of politics also meant a
diversion of religious energy from the normal ecclesiastical channels
to political ones. This posed a threat to continued Church leadership
of Ukrainian society. The new synthesis of moral-spiritual and
social-political currents proved an attractive competitor, especially in
the eyes of youth, to the Greek-Catholic Church.
       When in 1934 the Polish government repudiated the Minorities
Treaty, protesting its inequitable application, its claim that the
repudiation would make no difference in its treatment of its
minorities appears to have been correct. Nevertheless, Polish-
Ukrainian relations were exacerbated with the rise of the Polish
"Nara" party and the general rightward turn among the Endeks and
other sectors, especially under the "colonels" regime in the final
years before World War II. Yet on the eve of the 1935 elections, the
mainstream UNDO reached a compromise with the government,
under which it gained 18 seats in Parliament and the promise of
educational and other social concessions for Ukrainians. This
permitted a truce in Polish-Ukrainian politics for the next three
years. Not all the government's promises were fulfilled, however.
                                     38
       Ukrainian dissatisfaction surfaced again with the Czech crisis
 of 1938, when the analogy between Eastern Galicia and the
 Sudetenland became ominously obvious. Encouraged by the
Carpatho-Ukrainian example, UNDO began voicing renewed
demands for territorial autonomy. To many Ukrainians, Germany
appeared to be the only source of hope. In 1938 UNDO split again, on
the issue of cooperation with the Poles. Few on either side of the
Polish-Ukrainian conflict still clung to the notion, advocated by the
Promethean movement, of a symbiosis of the two nations on an equal
basis, without the assimilation or expulsion of either group, in what
was still a bi-national province. 87
       Although by the 1930s, familiarity with Soviet practices ruled
out any sympathy for the USSR among the overwhelming majority of
the Ukrainians of Eastern Galicia, it was foolhardy of the Polish
regime to rely so heavily on that factor and neglect basic political,
socio-economic and cultural reforms. At the same time, the economic
troubles of the middle class and the unemployment of much of the
intelligentsia -- aggravated in Eastern Galicia by national
discrimination -- fueled right-wing nationalist and even terrorist
sympathies. 88 Samuel Sharp criticises Polish policy in this period as
tragically irresolute: "The hesitant polish policies, combining
concessions that were not attractive enough with sporadic displays of
brutal yet not determined force, kept the Ukrainian issue alive
throughout the inter-war years." In his estimation, "inter-war
Poland was unable to work out an intelligent solution or even to
maintain a consistent approach to the problem of minorities." 89
       Ultimately, however, the Ukrainian problem was insoluble.
Both Polish and Ukrainian nationalism had reached the stage of
absolute and therefore mutually exclusive demands. In the event, the
issue was resolved by a third party, to the dismay of Poles and
Ukrainians alike.

3. The Church

     The Greek-Catholic Church in Austria was headed by the
Metropolitan of Halych, who was also Archbishop of L'viv. It

89    Id. 89.
                                   39
consisted of three eparchies (dioceses): the archeparchy of L'viv, the
eparchy of Peremyshi' (Przemyl), and the eparchy of Stanyslaviv,
founded in 1885. In Poland, the Church retained the same basic
structure, though in 1934 a special Apostolic Administration for the
Lemko Region was carved out of the Peremyshi' eparchy from its
nine westernmost deaneries.
       The Greek-Catholic parish clergy (excluding monastics)
numbered roughly 2,200 priests both at the beginning of the period
under study and at its end. Most numerous were those of the largest
eparchy, that of L'viv, which was followed by Peremyshl', Stanyslaviv,
and the Lemko Apostolic Administration. Since the forty-year period
from 1900 to 1939 is roughly the length of a clerical career, and
assuming a fairly equal distribution of age groups amongst the
Greek-Catholic parish clergy, one can assume that by 1939 nearly
every priest alive in 1900 had been replaced once. Thus, the total
number of Greek-Catholic parish priests in the period under study
would come th about twice 2,200, or 4,400.
       These priests lived in a multi-national and multi-ritual
province. L'viv was the seat of a Latin-rite archbishopric, while
Latin-rite bishops sat at Peremyshi' and Tarnów. There was also an
Armenian-rite archbishop at L'viv. While the small number of
Armenian-rite Catholic priests, as well as their high degree of
assimilation with the Polish nationality, render the question of their
relations with the Greek-Catholics virtually academic, the relations
between Catholic priests of the Greek and Latin rites are an
important topic.
       The developing attitudes of the Greek-Catholic clergy directly
affected their relationship with the Latin-rite clergy, who were of
almost exclusively Polish nationality. 90 In Galicia, a province of
mixed population, Greek-rite parishes with Ruthenian or Ukrainian
faithful overlapped with Latin-rite parishes with Polish faithful. On
the whole, the network of Greek-Catholic parishes was denser than
that of Latin-rite parishes. 911n Eastern Galicia, this was consistent
with the predominance of Ukrainians in the countryside. Whereas in

the larger towns, the Greek-Catholic priest would be part of the less
numerous or in any case less influential Ukrainian community, in
the countryside he clearly represented the majority.
        Yet the Greek-Catholic parish priest did not enjoy equal social
status with the Latin-rite priest even in the countryside.
Understandably, the Greek-Catholic clergy were sensitive on this
point. In a 1901 letter to the episcopal ordinariat in Peremyshi' from
the deanery office in Porokhnyk requesting that a 77-year-old priest
who had served for 53 years be designated a canon, it was pointed out
that the neighbouring Latin-rite priest, like nearly all the Latin-rite
priests in the area, was a canon and had violet buttons on his
soutane, "while next to him, the Ruthenian parish priest looks like
his assistant." 92 The difference in status would presumably be felt
acutely in areas where, as in Porokhnyk, Ruthenians were in the
minority.
        Polish clerical attitudes towards the Greek-Catholic Church
as a whole obviously affected relations between priests of the two
rites. In October 1917 Bishop losyf Botsian was introduced to the
prelate Mons. Pruszkiewicz (who had written of the Uniate martyrs
of Chehn and Polesie) in Lublin as "the bishop of Lutsk," without
designation of his rite. Bishop Botsian explained that he had desired
to visit Mons. Pruszkiewicz because of his works in defence of the
Union. The aged prelate, taking him for the Latin-rite Bishop of
Lutsk, reportedly told him that now he saw things differently, and
had told Pope Pius X that "now the Union is nothing but Ukrainian
propaganda." He added that both Archbishop Bilczewski of L'viv and
Archbishop Teodorowicz (Armenian-rite bishop of the same city) had
told the Holy Father the same thing. 93 Whether or not this anecdote
is true, it does reflect an attitude commonly attributed to the Polish
clergy by the Greek-Catholic priests. In 1902 Fr. Pryslopskii,
assistant priest in Dubets'ko in the Peremyshi' eparchy, accused a
Latin-rite catechist of ridiculing the Church Slavonic terminology
and the ritual of the Greek-Catholic Church. Fr. Pryslopskii's
complaints, covering various forms of 'latinisation" and

polonisation, were put forward in a brochure the title of which
pointedly referred to the "latinising Hakata" of the Polish clergy.
       A prime cause of Polish suspicions regarding the legitimacy of
the Greek-Catholic Church bore directly on relations with that
Church's clergy. This was the institution of married priests. In the
1920s Fr. Mieczystaw Tarnawski wrote in "Gazeta Kocie1na" that a
married clergy was part and parcel of the Byzantine tradition of
church dependence on the state, whereas a free, western church
required a celibate clergy unburdened by earthly matters. Ukrainian
politicians, he claimed, sought to make the Greek-Catholic Church a
national institution, and to harness the clergy to their political cause
through family ties. They feared priestly celibacy because it would
free the clergy and Church from their political control.
       Fr. Tarnawski was not hostile to the Greek-Catholic Church
as such, and did not, for example, portray it as a road to schism.
Pointing to the cohabitation of the Latin and Greek rite in Galicia
and to the common threats of Protestantism and of a national
"autocephalous" Church, he recognised that the Polish clergy had a
responsibility to help their Greek-Catholic brethren. Specifically, he
suggested that sermons on the same theme should be given at the
same time in the Greek-rite tserkva and the Latin-rite k p ci&t' of a
given locality, allowing people of both rites to discuss the dangers to
the Catholic faith that threatened them all. Among other things, he
advocated reviving the custom of taking part in processions of the
other rite (such as at the Latin Corpus Christi or the Byzantine
"Jordan"), for seeing that the other rite shared the same faith and
respected one's own rite would strengthen the faith of both. Priests
should coordinate and cooperate in pastoral work. All this, wrote Fr.
Tarnawski, would bring about harmony between priests and faithful

Germanisation of Poles in the Prussian partition by the three founders of the
Society of the Eastern Marches, Hahnemann, Kennemann and Tiedemann,

Poles and Polish treatment of Galician Ukrainians has been made repeatedly by
the latter. See Rollet, Henry. La Pologne au XXe Siècle. Paris, 1984, 53.

Mao p olsce (reprinted from "Gazeta Kocielna') Lw6w, 1926, 16-23. The
contention that a married clergy was spiritually weak and economically
dependent and therefore favoured by various enemies of the Church such as
schismatics, liberals, radicals, national democrats and socialists, had been
made earlier. Z.X.Y. Prawoslawie w Rosvi i jego todhe w Galic yi. Lw6w, 1912,

of the two rites, increasing their resistance to forces threatening
their common Catholic faith. 96
         Fr. Tarnawski's high-minded propositions were not effected.
In the inter-war period the clergy of the two rites gradually ceased to
take part in each other's services. Greek-Catholic priests would on
occasion advise their faithful not to take part in Latin-rite retreats or
pilgrimages. 97 In fact, the Greek-Catholic clergy seems to have
distanced itself from the Latin-rite clergy in general. 98 Hostile
activity did not cease; dean Mykola Makar of Stara Sil' reported in
1939 that at the deanery meeting of 6 June there had been discussion
of "Pobudka," a local periodical edited by a Polish priest which
attacked the Greek-Catholic clergy.
        The principal issue in inter-rite clerical relations was the
"Concordia" (as distinguished from Concordat) of 1863. This solemn
agreement between the two rites concerned various practical matters
such as change of rite, pastoral cooperation and inter-rite marriages.
To change rite, for example, a person had to apply to his bishop, who
would make the appropriate observations and pass the application to
the bishop of the other rite. The final decision would be made by the
Holy See in Rome. If a person were accepted by a priest of another
rite into that rite without following this procedure, the change of rite
would be void, and the priest would be penalised if he was aware that
the person belonged to the other rite. A priest could celebrate mass in
a church of another rite by Papal indult and with permission of the
rector. Baptism of an infant of another rite was permitted only in
emergencies or where a priest of the infant's rite could not be
reached; however, this did not bring with it a change of rite.
Ruthenian priests could not confirm a child of the Latin rite
immediately after baptism (as is the Eastern custom). The priest of
the infant's rite would have to be notified of the baptism. A priest
could hear confession and grant absolution to persons of the other

98 Of nine priests ordained in the inter-war period responding to a
questionnaire or interview question about their relations with the Polish clergy,
two replied that they had had no contact, one that he had had little, one said that
he had stayed away, one reported indifferent relations, one recalled cold but
polite relations, one cited bad relations and two reported good relations.

rite, but could not give them communion; however, extreme unction
and the viaticum could be administered to such persons if necessary.
Inter-rite marriage was not to be prevented; a priest of the wife's rite
must perform the ceremony. A child was to be raised in the rite of the
parent of its gender (i.e., a boy was to be raised in his father's rite, a
girl in her mother's). Among the exceptions to this rule were the
children of Greek-Catholic priests. Illegitimate children of either
gender followed the mother's rite. To perform a funeral of a person of
another rite, a priest needed the permission of the deceased person's
priest, but the faithful were free to bury the deceased in a cemetery of
the other rite. Provisions were made for mutual aid among priests of
different rites. 100
        A letter of 28 September 1899 to the Peremyshi' episcopal
consistory from the laborurer Andrei Iurkov of Sambir illustrates
the context in which conflicts between priests of the Greek and Latin
rites frequently arose. In 1893 Iurkov, under the influence of his
Polish neighbours, had had his son baptised in the Latin rite. "But
when I recognised from the teachings of our pastors that I had done
wrong, for being a Ruthenian I should have baptised the boy in a
tserkva, I went to the Latin-rite parish priest and asked him to give
me back the birth record so that I could transfer it to my own parish
priest, that is, of the Ruthenian rite." The Latin-rite priest replied
that he would only do this if a court ordered him to. The local
government authorities would not help either. He therefore requested
the Greek-Catholic consistory to appeal to the Latin-rite consistory to
prevail upon its priest to let him have the birth certificate, "for under
no circumstances do I want my boy to be brought up in the Latin
rite." 0' In May of 1900, a Greek-Catholic priest in Krakovets' sent
the Peremyshl' episcopal ordinariat a list of 44 children of the
"Ruthenian Catholic rite" in two villages who had been improperly
baptised in the Latin rite by one Fr. Szczepko. 102 In December of 1902

regulated by the Austrian law of 25 May 1868. In a report of 1 October 1929 to the
Ministry of Religious Cults and Public Education, the Stanyslaviv
(Stanisaw6w) governor argued that the Concordat of that year did not invalidate
that law, which should continue to be given effect as it was more in line with the
Polish Constitution, freedom of religion and Polish interests than the Concordia.

Fr. Pryslopskii, assistant priest in Dubets'ko on the San (Peremyshi'
eparchy), published a brochure in which he complained that in this
area of mixed population, entire villages had gone over to the Latin
rite in recent decades. Some of his Greek-Catholic faithful in
neighbouring Bakhorets', where there was only a Latin-rite priest,
Fr. Edmund Duczka, had recently left their rite. To remedy the
situation, Fr. Pryslopskii appealed for help in building a Greek-
Catholic church in Bakhorets'. 103
       More complicated was the situation described by a Latin-rite
priest in Brukhnal' in the same year. There, the daughter of a Greek-
rite father and a Latin-rite mother, who for some reason had been
baptised in a Greek-rite church, but whose birth certificate had been
sent to the Latin-rite church, wished to marry a man of the Greek
rite. The Greek-Catholic priest, a Fr. Volos, insisted that she marry
in his church. The girl's parents agreed that even if she were
married in the tserkva, she would make confession and take
communion in the koci&1'. The Polish priest asked the Greek-
Catholic episcopal ordinariat in Peremyshi' to decide who was to
perform the marriage, and remarked that this was not the first
instance of proselytism on the part of Fr. Volos. 104
       Since the general trend was for changes from the Greek to the
Latin rite,' 05 following the trend of assimilation of Ruthenians with
the Polish nation, the barriers to change of rite created by the
Concordia were usually favoured by the Greek-Catholic clergy, and
opposed by the Latin-rite clergy. The fact that a change of rite usually
meant a change of nationality engaged the clergy's patriotic feelings
as well. Priests of either nationality sought to reverse what they
perceived as denationalisation of their people.'° 6 In 1927 Fr. Merena,

and Polish nationality: "It must be stated that Polish culture, as a higher culture,
has more attractive force, and as a consequence the Ruthenians will have to
suffer constant sacrifices to her benefit." See also the report of 16 October 1929

dean at Ripnyk, in consenting to the transfer of a Greek-Catholic
married to a Latin-rite Catholic to his wife's rite, observed that the
pressures on a Greek-Catholic living in a Polish village would
compel him to transfer sooner or later. But he warned that this could
lead to mass transfers to the Latin Rite, especially in an irreligious
and unprincipled age. 107
       In 1938 the parish priest at Vil'shanyk in the Peremyshl'
eparchy wrote to the episcopal ordinariat that laymen were being
persuaded to change rite in exchange for employment such as
roadwork or a job with the local authority or post office. He suggested
that in cases of mixed-rite couples moving to a new parish, the
Greek-rite priest of the new parish should be alerted so that he might
ensure that the Concordat was being observed with respect to the
Greek-rite partner.'°8 The clergy of the Liubachiv (Lubaczów) and
Nemyriv deaneries were so alarmed by the tide of conversions to the
Latin Rite that at their meetings of December 1938, Fr. S. Denko spoke
at the former deanery on "How to Avert Mass Transfers from our
Rite to the Latin Rite," and Fr. Iaroslav Harasym spoke at Nemyriv
on "The Luring of the Faithful into the Roman-Catholic Rite, and
How to Defend against it." Among the measures recommended by
Fr. Harasym were education, improving ritual aesthetics, preventing
mixed-rite marriages or else requiring an oath that the children
would be baptised in the tserkva, and raising national consciousness.
109
      Although the Greek-Catholic clergy appealed to the Concordia
to prohibit changes to the Latin rite, according to some Polish
sources they were as ready as Latin-rite priests to ignore the
Concordia when it came to transferring persons to the Greek rite.
Indeed, the sources are replete with mutual accusations of
duszotapstwo -- "soul-snatching." 110 The density of the Greek-

Catholic parish network did often result in Latin-rite Poles availing
themselves of the services of Greek-Catholic priests." 1 Some of the
latter engaged in "revindication of souls" even in areas of mixed rite.
Fr. Stefan Makar, assistant priest in Nove Misto, proudly reported to
the Peremyshi' episcopal consistory in December 1912 that since
Easter he had brought ten souls from the Latin .rite church to the
Greek-Catholic church -- which had enraged the local Poles. This
had also led to scenes such as that in which first-former Kasia
Halaiko, one of Fr. Makar's religion pupils, was seized "amidst
shouting and shrieking" by the Latin-rite priest and the school
director, who said she must remain in the Polish religion class. 112
        Conversely, some Polish clergy favoured observance of the
Concordia. Fr. Józef Borodzicz advocated this as a measure to
prevent Orthodox schism, along with helping Greek-rite Poles return
to the Latin rite and introducing the Gregorian calendar for the
Greek-Catholics. He also called on the secular authorities to help set
up more Latin-rite parishes in Eastern Galicia. Fr. Borodzicz
predicted that some would fall into schism, where they "belonged,"
but that others would be definitively saved. 113
        In October 1929 the Ternopil' (Tarnopol) governor Moszyñski
reported to the Ministry of Religious Cults that the Concordia was a
"dead letter" in his county. Latin-rite priests were taking every
opportunity to baptise children who would properly be Greek-
Catholics in the Latin rite, in violation of the Concordia, and would
fail to inform the Greek-Catholic priests, as was required in such
cases. He remarked that the higher church authorities tacitly
assented to this practice, and consequently the parish priests
remained confident that they would not be punished. The Greek-
Catholic priests behaved similarly, he continued, taking advantage of
their numerical preponderance and denser parish network, and in

some cases even of winter weather barring believers' access to a
Latin-rite priest. 114
        The controversy over "soul-snatching" may have affected
relations between priests of the two rites in other matters. Before the
1920s, Greek-Catholic and Latin-rite priests had frequently
celebrated mass in each other's churches. 115 However, in his 1929
report governor Moszyi%ski noted that common services by Greek and
Latin-rite priests were only sporadic, and that any cooperation was
hard to imagine. He did remark that the Concordia's prescriptions
regarding confession, marriage, and extreme unction were
generally being observed. In some cases, priests of the two rites
helped each other, for example in funerals. However, they generally
refused to invite each other to participate in major ceremonies such
as those performed at Jordan (the Greek-Catholic Epiphany) or
Corpus Christi, or in pilgrimages. Yet he observed, significantly, that
the Latin-rite clergy would like the Greek-Catholic authorities to
compel their priests to invite them to their celebrations, and would
not refuse to invite them in return. In conclusion, Moszynski stated
that regulating the relations between priests of the two rites was a
very complicated matter, albeit one which the clergy regarded as
necessary. Since the clergy of both rites would respect the Concordia
only insofar as it coincided with their aims, only state enforcement
could put it into effect again. 116
        In his memoirs Oleksander Bryk, a Ukrainian layman with
anti-Catholic as well as anti-Polish sentiments, describes a Greek-
Catholic Epiphany celebration in his boyhood village of Kolodiivka in
which the local Poles were invited to participate. The priest would
transliterate the Church Slavonic of the Gospel reading into Latin
letters for the Latin-rite priest to read out. But "our people were not
pleased with such 'wspólvcie,' because they knew where it would
end. ••"117 As will be seen in the next chapter, lay attitudes influenced
the thinking and behaviour of the Greek-Catholic clergy in a variety
of matters.

       The social, economic and political changes of the period from
1900 to 1939 combined with the imposition of compulsory celibacy to
shatter the traditional way of life of a good part of the Greek-Catholic
clergy. As the priestly caste declined, its members were replaced by a
new type of priest: usually of peasant origin, often holding populist
sentiments, willing out of commitment or necessity to accept a
celibate life, consequently unburdened by family life, and in many
cases possessed of a strong vocation that entailed a willingness to
accept the harsh conditions and sacrifices of priestly life in inter-war
Galicia. Although in some ways these changes brought the Greek-
Catholic clergy closer to that of the Latin rite, the exacerbation of
national relations in the inter-war period rather increased the
distance between the two.
       The relationship of the Greek-Catholic clergy towards other
ethnic groups also bears mention. Here, the usual ethnic stereotypes
came into play, particularly with regard to groups with whom the
Galician Ukrainians had little direct contact, such as the Germans
and the Russians. The clergy's attitude towards the Jews poses a
special problem, for although Galicia had a heavy Jewish population
which performed important economic functions, this population
lived in considerable isolation. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi took a warm
interest in the Galician Jews, and favoured them so much that he
found it necessary to justify his attitude before society. During World
War II, he would save the lives of many. 118 There seems to be little
reason to suppose that the attitude of the Greek-Catholic clergy
towards the Jews differed from that of Ruthenian-Ukrainian society
in general, and after World War I clerical attitudes probably were
identical to peasant attitudes, since the peasantry provided the bulk of
priestly vocations. 119 Overly vague as the term may be, some kind of
"anti-Semitism" did apparently exist in Galicia, but the attitude of
the Christian population towards the Jews can best be described as
ambivalent. 120 Before World War I, anti-semitism was fomented by

118 Redlich, Shimon. "Sheptytskyi and the Jews During World War II,' in
Magocsi, 148-151. The essay briefly describes the Metropolitan's pre-war
relations with the Jews.

some politicians, particularly populists, for their own purposes; this
foreshadowed the militant anti-Semitism of national socialism after
the war. It was sometimes propagated by priests and teachers,
though ultimately the ones to act upon its implications were the
peasants.'21 In the city of L'viv, growing anti-Semitism sparked the
growth of Jewish nationalism, in the form of Zionism, in the 1880s.
The "economic crusade" of non-Jewish nationalists, involving
boycotts of Jewish merchants, was seen as a threat to the Jewish
community there.'22 In the countryside, the stereotype of the Jewish
merchant, bailiff or tavern-keeper who exploited the peasantry
persisted. In 1912 Fr. Roman Isaichyk, parish priest at lavornyk in
the laslo (Jaslo) deanery of the Peremyshi' eparchy, argued that he
should be allowed to serve as notary because the previous notary had
been a Jewish tavern-keeper who had exploited the peasants and sold
them liquor during civic meetings. His dean agreed.' 23 It is not
certain that such a perception of Jews was typical among the Greek-
Catholic clergy, but it was probably widespread. No doubt the memory
of Jewish opposition to the clerical temperance campaigns of the late
nineteenth century remained fresh. In any case, a reputation for
anti-semitism did arise. In 1935 Fr. Iuliian Dzerovych, reporting in
Nyva on that year's general meeting of the Society of St. Andrew,
mentioned that "when the Jews defamed our Greek-Catholic clergy
in English Judophile periodicals, [claiming that] it had taken part in
anti-semitic actions in Galician Ukraine, our Society raised a

the economy was weak and the Jews numerous. Id. 136. See also Golczewski,

populists of Fr. Stojahwski were hostile to both Jews and the upper Roman
Catholic clergy.

Alfred Nossig." The Slavonic and East EuroDean Review vol. XLIX no. 117

Jewish and non-Jewish nationalists did not conflict, since the latter sought to
build national states, while the Zionists sought to create a Jewish state in
Palestine. Indeed, both Zionists and anti-Semites agreed on the need for Jewish
emigration.

            PART ONE: THE EDUCATION OF
            THE GREEK-CATHOLIC CLERGY
        CHAPTER ONE: SCHOOL AND SEMINARY

        Some of the oldest Greek-Catholic priests alive in 1900 would
have attended primary and secondary school in the 1830s or 1840s,
and completed seminary in the 1850s. A priest ordained in the year
1900 typically would have been born around 1875, and attended
primary school in the earlyl88Os, a g ymnasium in the late 1880s and
early 1890s, and seminary in the middle and late 1890s. If he were
still alive in 1939, he would have been among the oldest Greek-
Catholic priests of that time. A priest ordained in 1939 typically would
have been born around 1914, and attended primary school in the post-
war years into the mid-1920s, secondary school in the 1920s and early
1930s, and seminary in the middle and late 1930s. In this chapter we
shall therefore consider the changes in the Greek-Catholic clergy's
primary and secondary education that occurred between the
nineteenth century, particularly its last two decades, under Austrian
rule, and the first decade and a half of Polish rule in Galicia. We
shall concentrate, however, on the development of seminary
education between the 1890s and the 1930s.

 1. PrimarySecondary Education
       The problem of primary and secondary education for Galician
Ruthenians has been discussed in the Introduction. The period of
Polish autonomy in Galicia saw a flourishing of Polish-language
public education, but also saw the development of Ruthenian primary
and secondary schools. By 1910, there were 2,457 Ruthenian
(Ukrainian)-language primary schoo1s in the province, though these
were largely one- or two-room affairs. 125 By 1914, there were six
Ruthenian state g y mnasia; in addition, some 15 private educational
institutions of various sorts were set up by the Ruthenian
intelligentsia. 126 Among the latter were the schools organised by the
Ukrainian Pedagogical Association in L'viv. 127

       With the collapse of Austria and the advent of Polish rule,
Ukrainian-language education encountered serious obstacles. In
1922 there were still 2,426 Ukrainian primary schools in Galicia,
with 2,247 Polish and 1,422 "utraquistic" (mixed) schools. 128 In 1925,
in the wake of the lex Grabski of the previous year, there were only
1,055 Ukrainian primary schools. 129 With clerical initiative and
support, the private organisation "Ridna Shkola" did succeed in
eventually founding 16 pre-schools and 41 primary schools, primarily
in the countryside; 130 thirty-one of the latter had been founded by
1928, along with 17 gvmnasia. 131 In 1930, however, there were only
four private Ukrainian gvmnasia, in addition to six state gvmnasia;
in the pacification of that year, Ukrainian secondary schools in L'viv,
Stanyslaviv, Rohatyn, Drohobych and Ternopil' were closed. 132
Although Ukrainian-language schools were established by the
government in areas of predominantly Ukrainian population, there
were schools with a Ukrainian majority where Polish was
nevertheless used as the language of instruction; however, the
teaching of the Ukrainian language was permitted. "Utraquistic"
schools, with some subjects taught in Polish and some in Ukrainian,
were established in areas of mixed population. 133
       Under the Polish constitution of 1921, religious instruction was
compulsory in Polish state-supported schools for all under the age of
eighteen. Such instruction was conducted and controlled by religious
bodies, under the ultimate supervision of the state educational
authorities. 134 The Concordat of 1925 extended this requirement to
private schools enjoying the rights of public schools. 135 For Greek-
Catholics, religious instruction was conducted in Ukrainian, by the
designated Greek-Catholic catechist.

       The need for secondary education preparatory to seminary
study was recognised by the Ruthenian Greek-Catholic Provincial
Synod of 1891, which provided in Title VIII, Chapter II of its Acts
Resolutions for the founding of minor seminaries. These were
intended to prepare boys for the seminary by way of thorough
secondary education and ascetic training. 136 In fact, the first minor
seminary was established only in 1919, in L'viv, under trying post-
war conditions. In the first decade of its existence it was merely a
hostel for pupils who attended state secondary schools. After the
pacification of 1930, and the attendant closing of several Ukrainian
schools, the minor seminary was re-organised as a full secondary
school, under the Dutch priest Jacob Perridon. Based on western
European models, the gymnasium began with the upper three forms
(sixth, seventh and eighth), adding the lower classes year by year
starting with 1931. A branch was established in Rohatyn. In 1932, the
Lviv minor seminary had 103 pupils, with 15 in the eighth form in
the Rohatyn branch. Although the minor seminary's matura was
not recognised by Polish universities, it sufficed for entrance not only
to the Greek-Catholic seminaries but also to Latin-rite Catholic
seminaries outside Poland and to the universities of Vienna, Prague,
Rome and Zagreb. A minor seminary was also established in
Stanyslaviv. 137
       Monastic orders also recognised the need for both primary and
secondary private education in a Greek-Catholic and Ukrainian
spirit. To this end, the Basilian order founded schools in Buchach
and Dobromyl', while the newly-founded Eastern-rite Redemptorists
established a school in Holosko.
       In the larger towns, primary and secondary-school pupils
from the countryside often lived in hostels operated by charitable
organisations. In the years before World War I, Russophile hostels
served to propagate their particular cultural and even political
orientation. To what extent, if any, these student hostels served to
educate future Greek-Catholic priests is difficult to ascertain. (The
Russophiles will be discussed in Chapter Six, Section 1.)
       Some notion of secondary education in the Austrian state
schools at the turn of the century can be derived from a brief memoir

of the Rev. Myroslav Ripets'kyi. Born in Sambir in 1889, Ripets'kyi
completed the four-year primary school in that town and entered the
Archduchess Elisabeth gymnasium in 1899, completing the eight-
year course in 1907. In the 1904-1905 school year, he reports on the
basis of vmnasium records, there were 654 pupils, of which Poles
numbered 329, Ruthenians 201, Jews 115 and Germans 9. Most of the
pupils were from beyond the thwn of Sambir.
       In the 1906-1907 school year, out of a thtal student body of 780
there were 532 Poles (including 134 Jews), and 248 Ruthenians. The
faculty consisted of 37 teachers. Ripets'kyi points out that despite the
ethnic heterogeneity of the pupils, there was no inter-ethnic hostility.
The gymnasium youth held a concert in honour of Adam Mickiewicz
in December 1906, and another for Taras Shevchenko the following
March. The school year opened with special masses in both the
Latin-rite and Greek-rite churches. 138
       Religious instruction for Greek-Catholic pupils in Ripets'kyi's
gymnasium was conducted by the Rev. flarion Hmytryk, an "Old
Ruthenian" who made several pilgrimages to the Holy Land and
spoke "in proper Ukrainian, but with some Church-Slavonic
expressions" mixed in. In 1891 he had published, at his own cost, a
four-volume Greek-Catholic Lives of the Saints. 139
       The young Ripets'kyi developed a love for literature during his
secondary school years, in part under the influence of the
subsequently prominent ethnographer Filaret Kolessa, who taught
Ukrainian literature there. In charge of the school's Ukrainian
library, "which was contained in two book-cases," Kolessa examined
each newly acquired book "and carefully crossed out every passage of
an anti-religious or immoral nature." Nevertheless, Ripets'kyi
recalls that he read nearly all the Ukrainian classics as well as
works of the contemporary literary circle "Moloda Muza," which
included Bohdan Lepkyi, Les' Martovych and Petro Karmans'kyi. He
also attended courses in Polish and German literature. 140
       The Rev. Ripets'kyi's political education also dates to his
secondary school years. During the 1905 revolution in Russia, his
elder brother, a university student, took him to a clandestine meeting

of "Russian revolutionaries," which lasted late into the night.
Returning home at dawn in his street clothing, Ripets'kyi
encountered his mathematics teacher, who took no measures other
than to give him an unsatisfactory note at the end of the semester.
In his fourth year, the future priest also joined the local hromada,
founded in the 1860s and part of a network of clandestine Ukrainian
secondary-school student organisations. In the hromada. writes
Ripets'kyi, "the foundations of the Ukrainian world view were
formed, and gymnasium pupils learned to be loyal sons of their
native people and to prepare for the struggle with the enemies of the
Ukrainian nation." The Sambir hromada, he recalls, maintained ties
with similar organisations in Berezhany, Ternopil', Stryi,
Peremyshl' and L'viv. The hromada had its own library, which gave
the pupils access to books and journals not available in the school
library (and not subject to Professor Kolessa's censorious pen). The
young Ripets'kyi presented a number of talks at these secret
meetings, on subjects including the works of Pushkin and
Lermontov. He continued his contacts with the Sambir hromada even
as a seminarian in L'viv. 141
       The future priest also engaged in legitimate extra-curricular
activities, joining the pupils' reading-room founded in November
1906. This organisation included both Poles and Ukrainians, and was
apparently modelled on the network of reading-rooms being set up
throughout the province for the education of the masses. Ripets'kyi
belonged to the Ukrainian section of the historical-literary circle (one
of five circles constituting the reading-room). Of the 65 members of
the Ukrainian section, 46 regularly read Literaturno-naukovyi
v istnyk ("Literary-scholarly Herald,") the foremost Ukrainian-
language journal of this type in Galicia. The members of this section
had access to the ideas of Ukrainian-orientated socialists such as
poet Ivan Franko and theoretician Mykhailo Drahomanov, and
Ukrainian writers such as Vasyl' Stefanyk. Ripets'kyi recalled that
the reading-room helped to develop its members' critical faculties,
"chiefly as a result of free discussion of the reading-room members'
talks." 142

       Were Myroslav Ripets'kyi's secondary education and
experiences typical for Greek-Catholic priests ordained on the eve of
World War I, or more broadly in the preceding decade and a half? In
his memoir he mentions a few schoolmates who were later ordained,
143 but it would be difficult to ascertain the number of graduates of
the Sambir gymnasium who became Greek-Catholic priests. It is not
certain that the general tenor of the school had been the same a
decade and a half earlier, when future priests who would be ordained
at the beginning of the period under study would have attended, and
it is certain that after 1918 the character of the school changed.
Furthermore, the Sambir gymnasium was considered one of the
better state secondary schools in the province, and obviously differed
from private secondary schools in atmosphere if not in academic
level. Ripets'kyi's memoir only hints at Russophile activity, which at
other schools and in different social milieus would have been greater.
At the same time, a school of this size and importance, drawing
pupils from the surrounding region as well as from the district town
in which it was located, can reasonably be supposed to have educated
a fair number of future Greek-Catholic priests. In its academic and
extra-curricular programme it must have closely resembled other
state schools. Reading-rooms and hromadv were a common feature
of Ruthenian Galician life in the years before World War One. Thus,
the young Ripets'kyi's exposure to Ukrainian, Polish, German and
general European culture, his contact with Polish and Jewish pupils,
and his initiation into Ukrainian political activity were probably
fairly typical. They contributed to the attitudes and world-view or
"mentality" of the generation of Greek-Catholic priests who began
their pastoral activity in the last years of Habsburg rule.
       The general decline, or at least arrested development, of
Ruthenian primary and secondary education in the wake of the
world war and the establishment of Polish rule in Galicia affected
the generation of priests ordained in the 1930s. The disruption caused
by the pacification of 1930, and the growing bitterness of Polish-
Ukrainian relations as well as nationalist activity among school
youth, further altered the general tenor of education during this
period. The Ukrainian graduates of a Polish state gymnasium or
private Ukrainian secondary school in 1932 had had very different

      However formative of character and general outlook one's
secondary-school experiences might have been, it was in the
seminary that one's priestly formation took place.' 45 In the Austrian
period, the bulk of Greek-Catholic seminarians attended the L'viv
seminary, taking their courses at the city's Emperor Francis
University. Ruthenian-language lectures in pastoral theology,
dogma, catechesis and methodology had been established at the
University in the 1840s. Life in the seminary was regulated by rules
set down in the acts of the 1891 Ruthenian Provincial Synod (Title
VIII, Chapter II, Annex XXXV), modelled on western European
seminary regulations and based generally on the decisions of the
Council of Trent. 146 The seminary in Peremyshi', founded in 1845,
provided only the fourth year of theological study for students who
had completed the first three years elsewhere -- normally at L'viv. 147
In 1896, the Peremyshi' seminary had three professors and 24
students in the fourth year (plus three at L'viv); in 1902 there were 18
fourth-year theology students. 148 A seminary was opened in
Stanyslaviv on 14 January 1907. 149
      In 1919 the new Polish authorities terminated Ukrainian-
language theology lectures at the L'viv University (renamed after
King John Casimir), and dismissed the Revs. Halushchyns'kyi and
Myshkovs'kyi, who had refused to lecture in Polish or to swear an
oath of loyalty to the Polish state. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi then
established courses at the Greek-Catholic seminary, which around
1922 became the Archeparchial Theological Lyceum. In view of the

liquidation of Ukrainian chairs at the University, the restriction of
admission in August 1919 to Polish army veterans, and the closing of
the Ukrainian underground university in 1925, the faculty of
philosophy established at the seminary became a sort of ersatz
university for Galician Ukrainians. 150 Forty-four students entered
the seminary in 1920, and all but one were ordained. Fifty-six entered
in the following year, and the number increased almost every year
for the next several years. The over-all number of students was
between 150 and 200 in the first half of the 1920s.151
       By 1915 the Peremyshl' seminary possessed an unfinished
seminary building, but military activity prompted the temporary
transfer of courses to I(romi in Moravia. On 13 December 1921, the
seminary building was dedicated. 152 By 1929, this seminary had nine
professors and 81 students; 153 in 1938 there were 110 students. 154
       The 1925 Concordat permitted bishops to create private
confessional educational institutions, which would enjoy full
internal autonomy. 155 In 1928 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi reorganised
the L'viv seminary as a Greek-Catholic Theological Academy. By the
latter 1930s this institution had a student body of between 350 and 400
students in its five-year course of study, with 30 professors and
lecturers in the faculties of philosophy and theology. 156
       In 1938 the Stanyslaviv seminary, which offered a four-year
course, was attended by 90 students. At the same time, four students
were being prepared for the Lemko Apostolic Administration

another attended the Byzantine-rite Pontifical Oriental Seminary in
Dubno. 157 Founded in 1928, the Dubno seminary was conducted by
Muscovite-rite Jesuits. Its 30 to 40 students, mostly Ukrainians, were
to work beyond Galicia, except for several designated for the Lemko
region. 158

3. The "Galician Monaco" and Seminary Reform
       At the Ruthenian Provincial Synod held in L'viv in 1891, the
Apostolic Delegate, Archbishop Ciasca reportedly told Bishop Iuhian
Pelesh of Peremyshi' that he had been amazed by the knowledge and
intelligence of Greek-Catholic priests from even the most obscure,
inaccessible mountain villages. "All my priests are like that,"
proudly responded Bishop Pelesh. 159 Nevertheless, the Synod felt that
the seminary that was producing these priests was in need of reform,
and on 1 September 1901, in his first year as Metropolitan, Andrei
Sheptyts'kyi issued a pastoral letter to that effect. 160
       What was wrong with the seminary? For one thing, the
seminarians' attitude left much to be desired. Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi criticised those who considered their room and board a
well-deserved gift, rather than the source of an obligation to their
Church and people. Such a seminarian, he noted, would become the
sort of priest who thinks that the people should feed him and work for
him -- precisely the sort of priest attacked in the Radical propaganda
of the time. The Metropolitan criticised those who played cards for
money in the seminary, for they, too, were motivated by an immoral
desire for gain without work. Others, he wrote, lived beyond their
means, incurring debts that they would later try to pay out of the
dowry of a marriage entered into for financial motives. He warned
that such candidates could be denied ordination. Laziness would not
be tolerated in the seminary; hard work must be motivated by faith
and piety. Indeed, work and piety are criteria of

a vocation, and those lacking the virtues necessary to become good
priests must be expelled, during the first year if possible. Another evil
that had to be eliminated was the strife and division among
seminarians caused by political loyalties. Intolerance of others'
political opinions, the metropolitan admonished, could seriously
harm a priest's pastoral work. Sheptyts'kyi also directed that the
duties of prefects should be better defined, and demanded a monthly
written report from the rector.161
       Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi was not alone in seeing the need for
seminary reform. Iaroslav Levyts'kyi, a L'viv seminarian writing in
May of 1901, applauded the reform then being considered by the
metropolitan. He felt that there was "excellent material" among the
Ruthenian theology students, whose increasing consciousness of the
situation of Church and people, combined with their greater activity
and zeal for self-improvement, pointed to a better future for the
national cause. A turning-point had been reached, he felt, and the
heralded reforms would find fertile ground. 162 Nevertheless,
Levyts'kyi was conscious of the low repute in which seminarians
were held:
             It is an indisputable fact that every intelligent
          Ruthenian person has a kind of strangely
          reserved attitude towards the Ruthenian
          theological seminary....
             You'll meet some secular person -- an older
          or younger person, or let's say a university
          student -- and as soon as you start talking about
          the seminary, you'll hear ridicule and jokes
          about the laziness, shiftlessness, card-playing
          and similar "virtues" of Ruthenian
          seminarians. Nowadays any gymnasium pupil,
          raised under the wing of the Ruthenian youth
          leaders of L'viv, will give you a similar opinion
          about the seminary.
             A large portion of secondary school graduates
          comes to the seminary with the same prejudice.
          What's more, even among the accused, among
          the seminarians themselves, you'll find those
          who'll sing you the same song about the
          seminary. 163

      Levyts'kyi recognises that this poor public image is not
altogether unjustified, but considers it exaggerated:
             I shall try to demonstrate that the Lviv
          seminary is not a house of loafers and
          freeloaders, that it is not a Galician Monaco, as
          Hromads'kyi Holos wrote last year. But I do not
          mean to say that our institution is ideal. This
          would be the opposite extreme. There are quite a
          few faults and lackings, their correction is
          needed and necessary, and we probably won't
          have to wait long for it. All the same time,
          looking at matters as they now stand, taking all
          the circumstances into account, we must draw a
          conclusion that is far removed from what I
          mentioned before.'64

       Levyts'kyi feels that all the evils of the seminary can be traced
to the conditions in which the seminarians are forced to live. First
among these is overcrowding:
             Where eight or nine people live at a single
          "address," there can be no thought of serious
          work. And it is difficult for the seminarians to be
          housed so that people with like personalities
          should end up together. If one wants to read,
          another to write, and at the same time a third to
          play the violin, a fourth to sing, a fifth to dance,
          etc., what can be the result of all this? True, the
          seminary has museums where one can study,
          but each museum must accommodate, on the
          average, 80 persons, and these are young, lively
          persons. And this is the greatest cause of the
          "shiftlessness" of the seminarians.
             Whoever is determined and makes up his
          mind will really prevail and will find the time
          and room to work -- but not everyone, and not for
          long. After a short while, each sleepless hour
          and even the shortest time spent in some cold
          corner will affect the health of such a
          seminarian. To all this one must add the dust
          and the unhealthful air in general, which in a
          closeted and sedentary life affect one's health
          most adversely. It is a fact that the greater part
          of the seminarians belong in a hospital rather
          than in a seminary. Stomach ailments,
          headaches, anemia, all kinds of catarrh, which
          plague a seminarian throughout his four years -
          - this is the blessing of the seminary, this is the
164   Levytskyi 5.
                          63

          incentive for intensive work! The same thing,
          incidentally, happens n other seminaries as
          well.165

       In addition, the author mentions the lack of an adequate
library, the students' helplessness and impracticality, the absence of
educational guidance and leadership, and the low pay of the prefects,
who must seek outside work to supplement their incomes. Thus, he
concludes, seminarians cannot be judged by the same standards as
their more fortunate colleagues in secular institutions. Nevertheless,
Levyts'kyi feels that spiritual life in the seminary is not as benighted
as some may think. 166
       Another seminarian, Osyp Ostashevs'kyi, writing in December
1913, relates that the students of 190 1-1902 were conscious of a need
for reform. He explains that Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, "following the
life of the seminarians, saw great lackings in their education, and
knew that such an education could not provide a clergy that would
correspond to the religious-cultural demands of its people and of the
present age." Furthermore, Ostashevs'kyi recounts that "our society
understood the importance of reform, for it knew that the
consequences of a reform would go beyond the walls of the seminary
and spread out in a beneficial stream amongst the entire people, and
therefore in 1901 our press spoke of it with joy." 167
       Petro Mel'nychuk, not an eyewitness to pre-reform seminary
life but, as biographer of the post-reform rector (and subsequent
Bishop of Stanyslaviv) Rev. Hryhorii Khomyshyn presumably
familiar with relevant documents, relates that late nineteenth-
century students of the L'viv seminary were not particularly
dedicated to study, due to the lack of spiritual or academic leadership.
Aside from morning mass, lectures, and evening prayer, their time
was their own, and few were serious about theology. Some took
advantage of their access to secular university courses to become
teachers. But many spent their free time playing cards or going out
into the town and returning late. In the mornings, he relates, the
spiritual director would visit the rooms to make sure that all had

gone to liturgy. To evade his inspection, students would hide under
their beds; others would lurk in wardrobes and make startling
noises, sending him scurrying away muttering about the "unclean
powers" haunting the rooms. 168 While Mel'nychuk's description has
the ring of student lore and may have been affected by a desire to
underscore the importance of the reforms, it does convey something
of the superficiality widely thought to have characterised pre-reform
seminary life.
       Thus, there was a general feeling in Galician Ruthenian
society at the turn of the century that the L'viv seminary was in need
of reform. However, judgments of the spiritual, academic and even
material level of seminary life necessarily depended on the frame of
reference. For example, in comparison with life in nineteenth-
century Russia's Orthodox seminaries -- a comparison that
Russophile clergy might have made -- the L'viv seminary might not
have appeared so deficient. 169 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's frame of
reference, and that of both the spiritual father at L'viv Rev. Isydor
Dol'nyts'kyi (educated at the Greek College in Rome) and the Rev.
Hryhorii Khomyshyn (educated in Vienna and rector at L'viv in 1902-
1904), was most likely the level of education prevailing in the central
and western European seminaries with which they all were
familiar. To the Russophiles, however, imitation of western
European and particularly Jesuit models would only augment the
already alarming degree of latinisation and polonisation in the
education of the Ruthenian clergy. 170 For at least some of the
seminarians and the lay public, the test of the quality of seminary
education was whether it could produce a clergy capable of
participating in the Ruthenian-Ukrainian national revival. Both
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's pastoral letter and Iaroslav Levyts'kyi's
comments also reveal a concern for the public image of the
seminarian and, ultimately, of the clergy itself. Those in favour of
reform realised that in order to eliminate the faults and abuses that
were grist for the Radicals' anti-clerical mill -- lazy, dissolute priests,
exorbitant sacramental fees, clerical obscurantism -- they would
have to start at the level of the seminary.

       Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's reform of the L'viv seminary was
radical. It was completely re-organised, nearly all the personnel
were replaced, and the rules were simplified. A major role was
played by the Rev. Dol'nyts'kyi, who had already done much to settle
earlier liturgical controversies. 171 To improve spiritual life the
Basilian monks (who themselves had been reformed, by the Jesuits,
in 1882) were brought in to give retreats. 172
      Was the reform successful? The best measure is the quality of
the priests that it ultimately produced. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's
biographer Cyrille Korolevskij, a French priest who adopted the
Byzantine rite (and a Slavic pseudonym), finds that "with the
progress made after the reform of the seminary, the metropolitan
possessed a respectable number of priests who had been very
correctly instructed and educated, and who were in no way inferior to
the best members of the Polish clergy." 173

4. Seminary Life
       Under the prescriptions of the L'viv Ruthenian Provincial
Synod of 1891, priority in entrance to the seminary was to be given to
those who had shown signs of a priestly vocation. 174 Under the
reformed rules of the L'viv seminary, an entrant must have
completed secondary school and passed the matura examination.
With his application addressed to the metropolitan, he must submit,
besides his matura certificate, a certificate of baptism and
confirmation and evidence of irreproachable conduct and of good
health. An applicant requiring room and board must be prepared to
pay for them. Those applying from other eparchies must have their
bishop's consent. A satisfactory knowledge of Latin was required for
entrance to the Faculty of Philosophy of the L'viv seminary (as re-
organised in 1928 with Academy status), and in addition, Greek was
required for the Faculty of Theology. 175

        Under Austria, the state funded seminary education and
strictly limited the number of places. 176 Under Poland, these matters
were covered by the 1925 Concordat with the Holy See. The number of
applicants was often high in relation to the number admitted. In
1921, out of 150 applicants to the expanded L'viv seminary (now
offering its own courses), only 56 were accepted. 177 An applicant who
entered ten years later recalls that "in those times, it was not easy to
get into this one Ukrainian higher school, for there were more
candidates than places in the Theological Seminary." He adds that
many entrants did not graduate; of the more than 200 admitted in the
winter of 1931, only 58 completed the L'viv Academy's five-year
course in 1936. 178
       What, aside from a vocation, motivated young men to enter the
seminary? Whereas in the nineteenth century, Sons of priests studied
theology as a matter of course (see Chapter Four), the entry into this
former caste of young men of other social backgrounds in the
twentieth century, as discussed below, was often accompanied by an
idealistic motivation. In the changed social climate after the World
War, a priest's son readily could be expected to enter a secular
profession as readily as the priesthood. The choice of seminary was
no longer automatic, and required a strong vocation or other motives.
In 1923 Bohdan Nehrebets'kyi, a priest's son who had studied
medicine and taken part in the Austrian defence of Peremyshl',
where he was taken prisoner and sent to Siberia, applied to the
Peremyshl' seminary. Among the motives that he mentioned in his
application were a desire to help the suffering, for both humane and
religious reasons. He had thought deeply about the war and the
Russian revolution, he explained, and had sought the causes of
physical suffering and human bestiality. Men's minds had become
materialistic, and they ignored the commands of the Decalogue; thus,
there had been a decline in ethics and morals. The people's soul, he
felt, could only be healed by coming "back to Christ" -- and

Nehrebets'kyi had resolved to spread this slogan among the masses
as a priest. 179
       There could be other reasons for a Ukrainian to wish to enter a
seminary in Polish-ruled Galicia. Ukrainians could enter Polish
universities only with the greatest difficulty. A numerus clausus was
imposed that excluded most Ukrainians unable to call on high
connections or pay bribes, or unwilling to change over to the Latin
rite (and thereby adopt Polish nationality). Few had the funds to
study abroad. For many, the seminary offered the only opportunity for
higher education (although the Vatican, possibly under pressure
from Polish circles, did not accord even the Academy the status of a
degree-granting university 180). This, writes one graduate of the
Greek-Catholic Academy, was the reason for the multitude of
"vocations" in the inter-war period. He adds that some may have
been motivated by purely material considerations. 181 Such motives
were probably more widespread in the 1930s Depression.
       The social composition of Greek-Catholic seminarians
changed between the 1890s and the 1930s. In 1894, about half the
alumni at Peremyshi' -- 13 out of 25 -- were sons of priests. Five were
sons of peasants, three of townsmen. In 1900 and 1904, just under
one-third of the alumni (seven out of 24 and six out of 19, respectively)
came from priestly families; in 1900 peasants' sons already
outnumbered those of priests. Although the proportion of priests'
sons remained roughly the same (close th one-third) in 1914 and 1921,
peasants' or farmers' sons (the terminology in the records varies)
outnumbered them in those years and in 1922 through 1924, with the
proportion of clerics' sons falling to one out of seven, three out of 20
and six out of 35 at Peremyshi' in those latter three years. Among the
other seminarians at Peremyshi' between 1894 and1924 were sons of
townsmen, teachers, church cantors, judicial officials, smiths, and
workers or craftsmen. 182 A similar mix was to be found at L'viv,
where there were students not only from all of Galicia but also from

Eastern Ukraine, Volhynia, Bukovyna, Carpatho-Ukraine,
Yugoslavia, Germany, North America and elsewhere. 183 A 1936
graduate of the L'viv Academy recalls that priests' Sons constituted
only some ten percent of the students in his time, the rest being sons
of peasants, townsmen "and very rarely, of the intelligentsia." They
varied in age from 17 to 40. 184 Some seminarians were also war
veterans. Between 1920 and 1926, almost all the students of the L'viv
seminary had completed military service and had fought in the
world war or the Polish-Ukrainian war. 185
        As suggested above, the spiritual life, physical conditions and
discipline in the seminary were all related. Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi's reforms announced in his pastoral letter of 1901 were
aimed at improving all three, along with the academic level. They
were incorporated in the revised statute of the L'viv theological
seminary (and later academy). These supplemented the decisions of
the 1891 Provincial Synod. 186
        Spiritual life was naturally of prime importance. Seminarians
were expected to make weekly confession and daily examination of
conscience, to take frequent communion, to engage in spiritual
reading, pray frequently before the Blessed Sacrament and cultivate
especial reverence for the Blessed Virgin Mary. Besides participating
in all the services in the seminary chapel, they were to take part in
festive services in the cathedral of St. George, both on major religious
holidays and during Ukrainian national celebrations. 187
Seminarians must also be spiritually prepared for self-denial and
sacrifice. 188 They were to give alms insofar as possible. They were
encouraged to master practical subjects that could enable them to
serve their neighbour in the future. Each year, they must make an
eight-day retreat, with a special three or five-day retreat just before

ordination. A seminarian who did not take religious practices
seriously and zealously, instead performing them merely out of
obligation and exhibiting a worldly spirit, was to consider himself
lacking a vocation and must leave the seminary at once. Obedience,
brotherly love and solidarity were also to be cultivated. 189
      The rules regulated discipline and physical conditions quite
explicitly. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's 1901 pastoral letter had
warned seminarians to avoid the influence of those who liked "cards,
debts and wine," 190 and accordingly, the revised rules forbade cards
or gambling, warned against debts, and prohibited alcohol in the
rooms, listing drunkenness among the grounds for expulsion. 191
Strolls outside the seminary walls were limited to two hours, and
must be undertaken in pairs; seminarians could not visit inns,
restaurants, cinemas, theatres or concert halls, or attend balls,
public festivities or meetings. 192 Smoking was allowed, but only in
the garden and in the students' rooms, and never between evening
prayers and breakfast. 193 Seminarians could not engage in editing or
contributing to periodicals without the rector's permission. 194 The
rules regulated hygiene, courtesy and manners, emphasising that
conversations must be carried on calmly, decently, and to the point,
"as befits a civilised person." 195 The framers of the rules apparently
were conscious of a need to improve the public image of the
seminarians (and presumably of the clergy as a whole), for they
exhorted them to avoid coarse language and behaviour in public, ill
befitting priestly dignity. In particular, loud talk or laughter,
shouting, looking about, loitering before shop-windows or staring at
passers-by, or waving one's arms about, were discouraged.' 96 Twice
a week during the academic year, seminarians were to take a two-
hour walk in groups of four comprising one student from each class,
under the direction of the eldest. 197
       The rules encouraged seminarians to admonish each other in
case of infraction of the rules, and should this not be heeded, to

inform their superiors. 198 Obviously, this could be misunderstood as
inviting denunciations, which one unsympathetic source claims
were common. 199 However, in 1920 the dean, Rev. Tyt
Halushchyns'kyi, expelled a student who had informed on a
colleague, and at that time at least, denunciations were discouraged.
Halushchyns'kyi, who served as dean in 1920-1921 and again in 1924-
1925, reportedly had a mild manner of calling seminarians' attention
to their faults, which was very effective.200 Nevertheless, a certain
amount of surveillance over seminarians' activities was inevitable.
Rule 56, requiring students to post letters at a designated box and
never in town, seems to suggest that letters might be read by the
seminary authorities, which the hostile source referred to above
claims as having been the case. 201 Even a sympathetic observer like
Korolevskij finds, in commenting on the ratio of one prefect to fifteen
students, that discipline at L'viv was based on constant supervision
rather than on individual conscience. The supervision extended
beyond the seminary, for even during holidays at home, a
seminarian was under the supervision of his parish priest -- a less
liberal treatment than that accorded French or Belgian
seminarians, 202 though perhaps more so than that imposed on
Polish seminarians. 203
       In the first years of the enlarged seminary of the 1920s, both
academic and spiritual life was in the hands of the Basilian monks
who, according to alumnus Nykolai Voiakovs'kyi, inculcated in the
students a love of the spiritual life and a spirit of self-sacrifice.
Indeed, he recalls that the material conditions at the L'viv seminary
provided an excellent opportunity to practise self-denial, for there
were food shortages and rationing. The constant lack of funds
prevented the administration from repairing broken windows, so
that one night, when the wind blew out the newspaper covering
Voiakovs'kyi's window, the snow fell in and his hair froze to the
pillow. In 1920-192 1 there was a shortage of fuel. For three months,
supper consisted of potatoes, bread, and tea with saccharine. When
conditions improved, luxuries like sugar and salt occasionally

became available. 204 Voiakovs'kyi also recalls the spiritual
"metamorphosis" effected by the Rev. Halushchyns'kyi's first
sermon during the yearly eight-day retreat, persuading the
seminarians that fulfilling the rule of absolute silence during the
entire eight days was not beyond their powers. 205 Indeed, physical
hardship may have promoted spiritual growth. In the 1930s, once or
twice a month between ten and fifteen students at a time would eat
only the soup course at meals, offering their second course to poor
students who could not afford to pay for meals in the refectory. 206
       Both Voiakovs'kyi and Volodymyr Pelekh, who attended the
L'viv seminary about ten years after him (in 1931-1936), speak
warmly of student-faculty relations, noting that the seminarians
referred to their rector as "daddy." 207 In fact, such a filial
relationship was mandated by the rules. 208
       Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's reform and subsequent expansion
of the L'viv seminary affected academic life no less than spiritual life.
Yet change was slow in coming. In 1916, a priest had complained in
Nyva that the seminarians were being taught almost nothing of the
history of the Greek-Catholic church and rite, and did not even have
the chance to learn the Bible in the church language in which they
would celebrate mass as priests. Seminary graduates, having been
taught in Latin, did not know Ukrainian theological terminology,
while the only available book on the history of their church was in
German. 209 As long as the L'viv seminarians had to take their
courses at the University, this was likely to remain the case. In 1919,
however, courses were instituted at the seminary. By 1922 or 1923, the
students could study Church Slavonic, the history of the Greek-
Catholic Church, and Eastern dogmatics, and art history, as well as
novel subjects like "Causes of Atheism" and "The Social Question,"
both taught by the Rev. Havryil Kostel'nyk. The noted philologist and
Orthodox theologian Ivan Ohienko taught Ukrainian orthography,
and the well-known Eastern Ukrainian poet Mykola Voronyi, now in

exile from Soviet Ukraine, was brought in for a while to teach diction
and the art of lecturing; his declamations reportedly made a lasting
impression on the students. 210 When in 1928 the seminary became a
full-fledged five-year academy, obviating altogether the need for
students to attend lectures at the University, this programme was
expanded.
        The founding of the Academy was not, however, an easy
matter. The government, suspecting nationalist aims, sought to block
the project. 211 In the meantime, the Rev. Tosyf Slipyi travelled to
western Europe to study theological education and examine the
statutes of higher theological institutions. He prepared a statute for
the L'viv academy, which was discussed by a three-man commission
and approved by the metropolitan on 22 February 1928. The Academy
was not officially opened until 6 October 1929, with Rev. losyf Slipyi as
rector. In his speech on that occasion, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi
outlined the new institution's aims, pointing out that they were
conditioned by his Church's special position as a mediator between
the Byzantine East and the Latin West. 212 He also observed that
whereas at the turn of the century, when materialism still prevailed,
theology was not considered a science, over the past thirty years this
attitude had changed. 213
        The contemporary press generally saw the Academy as the
germ of either a Ukrainian university or a Catholic Oriental
university intended to educate priests who in turn could teach the
faith in a manner comprehensible to the peoples of the East. 214 In its
first three years (1928-1931), the Academy had around 150 to 190
students from the L'viv archeparchy and several from the
Peremyshi' eparchy; 116 completed their studies during this time. 215
These students followed a five-year course the that reflected the
metropolitan's concern with teaching both the Western and Eastern

response to the challenge presented by the Orthodox theological faculties in
Warsaw and Cernauti (Romania). Such a response was impossible at the
latinised and polonised theological faculty at the University of Lviv.

 church tradition. The desiderata set forth in the pseudonymous
 article of 1916 in Nyva cited above, 216 already embodied in the
 seminary's programme of courses in the early 1920s, were expanded
 upon. A lay church historian, Mykola Chubatyi, taught a pro-
 seminar, a seminar in general church history, a two-semester
 course on the Metropolitanate of Kiev and the Ukrainian-
 Byelorussian Church, and a Ukrainian church history seminar for
 the upper three years. Ivan Krypiakevych, another prominent lay
 historian, taught general Ukrainian political history. The
 metropolitan himself taught Eastern and Western ascetics. Three
 courses and two seminars in Church Slavonic were taught along
with Greek and Hebrew. Volodymyr Zalozets'kyi taught Byzantine
 and Ukrainian art history; another lay authority, Iaroslav Pasternak,
lectured on archaeology. Courses on anthropology and the history of
music were offered in addition to the more traditional subjects. 217
       Academy training was not purely theoretical, for each fourth
and fifth-year student had to prepare and deliver one sermon. A
student who had mastered the required subjects could pursue other
interests that could be useful in his priestly work, and in general the
academy sought to introduce all seminarians to areas of knowledge
beyond the basic curriculum. 218
       An academy required an ample library. Although a Soviet
source presumably having access to seminary records claims that
the library had only about 1,000 books, 219 an émigré work states that
there were over 12,000. 220 Students were expected to procure their
own textbooks, though they could not obtain other types of books or
subscribe to periodicals without the rector's permission. 221
       Extra-curricular activities were a prominent feature of
seminary life both before and after the L'viv seminary reform and
subsequent expansion, and at Peremyshi' as well. The seminary
rules at L'viv allowed free time after dinner until two o'clock,
between 4:00 and 4:45, and then from supper until 8:30. Seminarians

could walk in the garden, converse, play chess, volley-ball or bowls, or
read. 222 One seminarian of the 1930s spent his free time learning
wood-carving and inlay work. 223 There was organised group activity
as well. A musical club had a chorus and orchestra, and staged
comic reviews satirising prefects, faculty and even the rector. 224
Probably the oldest group at L'viv was the Brotherhood of the
Presentation of the Virgin, founded by the Rev. Isydor Dol'nyts'kyi in
1885 and still active in the 1930s, which enjoyed special indulgences
as well as its own chapel. 225 A Marian Sodality was organised in
1913 as a section of this brotherhood. 226 The "Reading-room" Society,
founded in 1849, possessed a library of 1,132 volumes in 1898, the
largest category of which was Ruthenian and Russian belles-lettres.
227 After a period of apathy, the "Reading-room of Ruthenian-

Ukrainian Seminarians" was revived in 1902. About the same time,
Russophile students formed a "Circle of Russian Students of the
Faculty of Theology," which organised an evening programme in
honour of Pushkin but was soon closed down by the administration
for its overtly pro-Russian views. A quarterly journal called
Katolytskyi Vskhid ("The Catholic East") was founded. The Slavic
Circle, which had foundered in the pre-reform years, was revived
and became particularly active in1905. Its members corresponded
with seminarians in Transcarpathia, Bukovyna, and Russian
Ukraine, and even hosted a delegation of Transcarpathian
Ruthenians. Among their aims was to raise the national
consciousness of these groups. The Slavic Circle also maintained
contacts with Czech and Slovenian seminarians. 228
       In order to increase their contacts with the popular masses,
the L'viv seminarians organised an "Enlightenment Committee" in
1908, which sent its members to give talks at reading-rooms in the
area. This committee became the "Enlightenment Circle," and
around 1908-1909, with the decline of the Slavic Circle and the journal
Katolytskui Vsk hid, it became a focus of extra-curricular activity. In
their expeditions to the countryslde the seminarians came up

against the anti-clerical efforts of secular enlighteners, but also
gained the approval of the Prosvit p ('Enlightenment") organisation
and at least some of the press. 229 They set up reading-rooms and
agricultural societies -- good preparation for their future social
activism as parish priests. They also worked with neglected children,
and prided themselves on preserving them from Polish influences.
230

       Although a Theological Circle was still functioning in 1913,
other groups, like the temperance and literary societies, languished
in the first decade and a half after the seminary reform. 231 The
Theological Circle was re-organised as the "Theological Scholarly
Society of Ukrainian Seminarians in L'viv," and published an
almanac in 1914. 232 Around this time the temperance and literary
circles were revived, and a sports club was begun. After student
participation in the Vienna Eucharistic Congress in September 1912,
there was a rebirth of spiritual life, and the Markiian Shashkevych
memorial reading room was founded. Its members arranged
subscriptions to German and Polish theological journals and gave
charity benefit concerts. 233
       The Brotherhood of the Presentation, the Enlightenment
Reading-room and a number of cooperative, temperance, and other
circles within the seminary gave the students a taste of the
Ukrainian organisational life in which they would be expected to
participate as priests. 234 In one form or another, these groups
continued at L'viv after the first world war. In addition, the seminary
chorus became well known throughout Galicia, and in the 1930s it
toured the province. Its audiences occasionally included noted
composers such as Liudkevych and Barvins'kyi. 235 Organising the
seminary orchestra was more difficult, however; instruments which
had been used by the Sich Sharpshooters in the war had to be
borrowed from the Lysenko Musical Institute. 236

        Jubilees were an important feature of Ruthenian and
 Ukrainian culture, and the Lviv seminarians organised or
 participated in a number of celebrations of events deemed significant
 by Church and society. Among these were the centennial of the birth
 of the Rev. Markiian Shashkevych, a writer, member of
 the"Ruthenian Triad" and popular enlightener, in 1911; the lGOOth
 anniversary of the Edict of Milan and the 300th of the death of
 Metropolitan Ipatii Potii, an initiator of the Union of Brest, in 1913;
 and, in 1937, the 300th anniversary of the death of Metropolitan losyf
 Veliamyn Ruts'kyi, an advocate of Uniate-Orthodox union, and the
 centenary of the publication of Rusalka Dnistrova, a collection of
 Ruthenian folklore among the publishers of which was the Rev.
 Shashkevych. 237
        At the Peremyshl' seminary, extra-curricular activity was less
 developed. The absence of any organisations at that seminary until
 the appearance of the "Scholarly Circle" in 1922 may be explained by
the fact that this had not been a full four-year seminary until the
preceding year, and that fourth-year students generally had the least
 amount of free time; furthermore, as long as there was only a fourth-
year class there, the next class to arrive each year would have lost
touch with its predecessor due to their physical separation, virtually
foreclosing continuity in the work of any student organisations. 238
       The members of the "Scholarly Circle" pursued theology,
contemporary literature, and the propagation of the Ukrainian
language. In the year of its founding, the Circle had a library of 25
books, and presented seven lectures, mostly on practical subjects. In
the following year, about 100 books were acquired. Subscriptions were
opened to several secular and theological journals. Work began on
an almanac, which was published on the 300th anniversary of the
death of St. Josaphat Kuntsevych (considered the chief Ruthenian
Uniate martyr), in 1923. In 1923-1924 the Scholarly Circle organised
lectures on such diverse subjects as medicine, icons, and charitable
work in the villages. Later lectures concerned topics ranging from
autocephaly to bee-keeping. About this time a museum was also set
up, on the initiative of the rector, the future bishop Rev. Hryhorii

Lakota. In the latter half of the 1920s, however, the society declined,
because of the lack of seminarians in the wake of the introduction of
compulsory priestly celibacy in 1925 (see below, and Chapter Four,
Section 1). In 1927-1928 the society gave no lectures, but spent 29 zloty
on books, and donated 10 zloty to the Prosvita society and five zloty for
political prisoners. After this, there began a period of renewal of the
Scholarly Circle. 239 The group was still active in 1937. 240 A
cooperative of theology students seems to have existed at Peremyshi'
too, and in 1937 the seminarians published another almanac. 241
        The academic level at Peremyshi' is described by several of its
graduates who attended in the l930s as good or satisfactory. 242 One
graduate complains, however, that church history was taught
separately from the history of the people, and that altogether there
was too little patriotic education, with a lack of jubilee celebrations
and special lectures. He also criticises the absence of foreign
anguages in the curriculum, and the superficial treatment of canon
law. Finally, he feels that there was too little practical education --
though another graduate says the opposite. 243 Another finds the
level high, and recalls that the programme was demanding. 244
       Two Peremyshi' graduates of the 1930s recall that discipline
was harsh; one of them characterises this as a Latin-style
innovation. He states that seminary life was based on the monastic
system, with seminarians sleeping in ten- to twelve-bed dormitories
in the first two years and rising at 5:30. Holidays were limited to two
months in the summer. Generally, discipline as described by this
individual resembles that prevailing in L'viv. 245 The other graduate
recalls that the seminary administration showed a lack of trust in
the students, relying instead on harsh methods and constant
surveillance. There was a lack of recreational activities. He also
observes that during the summer holidays, the seminarians were
given too little to do by their parish priests, their duties usually being

limited to serving at the liturgy; Polish priests, by contrast, were
 more demanding in this respect. 246
        There is little information available about the Stanyslaviv
 seminary. Hostile accounts focus on the controversy surrounding the
introduction of compulsory priestly celibacy in that eparchy in 1920,
 and even a most sympathetic biography of Bishop Khomyshyn of
 Stanyslaviv, whose long tenure (1904-1945) saw the establishment of
his diocesan seminary in 1907, limits the discussion of priestly
 education almost entirely to the celibacy issue. 247 (This issue will be
discussed below and in Chapters Four and Seven.) Several memoirs,
however, provide a fragmentary picture of life in the Stanyslaviv
seminary. 248
        Like their precedessors. the over 30 students accepted in the
first year in 1906 were sent to the L'viv seminary from the Stanyslaviv
eparchy to take courses at the University, but after the Christmas
holidays became the first entering class at the new Stanyslaviv
seminary. Their rector was a Basilian monk, Rev. Ieremiia
Lomnyts'kyi. 249 By 1922-1924, the number of seminarians at
Stanyslaviv was 140.250
       As in the L'viv seminary, young men entered the seminary at
Stanyslaviv for a number of reasons besides some sense of vocation.
The Rev. Petro Mel'nychuk, ordained in 1928, began his university
studies at the secret Ukrainian university in L'viv in1922. GIven the
uncertain conditions of the times he and a few friends decided to
study theology at Stanyslaviv, since admission to the other Greek-
Catholic seminaries was closed. Although Bishop Khomyshyn
seemed displeased that the youths were applying to his seminary in
the middle of the academic year and only as a last resort, he accepted
them. 251
       In the first years after World War I, material conditions were
about as dlfficult in Stanyslaviv as at L'viv and Peremyshi'.
Mel'nychuk mentions that many of the students were war veterans
who were poor and lacked appropriate clothing. Students received no

money from the state. The seminary food was insufficient, the rooms
were cold, and there was a lack of fuel. 252 In addition, seminary life
was intentionally hard. A seminarian of 1923-1925 who left over the
celibacy issue recalls that the rigorous discipline helped to build
spiritual life. Upon being awakened by the bell in the morning,
seminarians had to maintain silence in the halls on their way to the
chapel, where they would spend an hour on their knees in meditation
on the subjects presented to them by the spiritual father on the
previous evening. Next came a liturgy, and it was only after another
ten minutes of thanksgiving in the chapel that the students could
proceed to the refectory for a rather modest breakfast and the day's
first opportunity to converse. After lectures and dinner there was
time for chess, billiards, discussions, jokes and anecdotes, followed by
a one-hour walk beyond the town limits. There followed more
lectures, study time, supper, and the presentation of topics for the
next morning's meditation. 253
       Under the rectorship of the Rev. Lomnyts'kyi, Bishop
Khomyshyn, who as rector at L'viv in 1902-1904 was familiar with
Sheptyts'kyi s reform, assembled a distinguished faculty including
the Basilian Tyt Halushchyns'kyi, the Basilian and future bishop of
Peremyshl' losafat Kotsylovs'kyi, the future bishops Ivan
Liatyshevs'kyi and Nykolai Charnets'kyi, and the Rev. Iakiv
Medvets'kyi, future Apostolic Administrator for the Lemko region.
Bishop Khomyshyn paid close attention to the seminary and
students, all of whom he knew personally, and frequently attended
their leisure activities to converse with them. 254 Considered by the
Rev. Mel'nychuk to have been both demanding and dedicated, Bishop
Khomyshyn lectured at the seminary every evening. 255
       The process of seminary reform that began with the
Ruthenian Provincial Synod of 1891 and continued with Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi's 1901 pastoral letter, the Rules of the L'viv seminary
and the its expansion in the 1920s to the status of academy, also
affected the Peremyshl' and Stanyslaviv seminaries. Bishop

 closely supervised his diocesan seminary at Stanyslaviv. Bishop
 Kotsylovs'kyi, who oversaw the expansion of his seminary at
 Peremyshi', was a Basilian who had taught at Stanyslaviv. The
 general tenor of seminary life appears to have been the same at L'viv,
 Stanyslaviv and Peremyshi', except that with jts elevation to the
 status of academy, the L'viv seminary afforded much greater
 educational opportunities.
       The reform was aimed at improving the status of the Greek-
 Catholic clergy, in the sense of both their real abilities and their
image in Ruthenian-Ukrainian society. Discipline, asceticism and
 spiritual guidance would produce better priests. A broader
intellectual outlook would produce clergymen that could compete
 successfully with the secular and often anti-clerical intelligentsia for
influence among the masses. Extra-curricular activity would
prepare seminarians for the secular organisational life in which
they would participate as pastors, and thus help to break down the
barrier between clergy and laity. Outside interests, and a better
familiarity with the niceties of social life (including conduct and
manners) would help the priests establish stronger ties with the
growing Ukrainian middle class as well as the peasants. A spirit of
self-sacrifice would prepare candidate priests for the challenge of
promoting the Union in the East. The decline of Russophilism (see
Chapter Six) and the entry of peasants' sons into the seminary
probably facilitated these reforms.
       Such a transformation of seminary, seminarians and
ultimately of clergy would have to be an inner transformation for the
individuals involved. Such an inner metamorphosis inevitably would
be reflected in what Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi called the "spirit of the
institution" (dukh z pklpdu). This in turn would work to transform a
gymnasium student into a priest -- indeed, Sheptyts'kyi felt that the
spirit of the institution could do more in this regard than all the
prefects. 256 This spirit could be described as the sum of "the desires,
goals, abilities, general opinion, general feeling about learning and
piety, the average degree of conscientiousness in fulfilling
obligations, the average level of studiousness." The spirit of a good
seminary was "generally correct views on the work and obligations of
a priest, on the tasks of the Church, a general eagerness among the

256   Szeptycki, List Dasterski 15.
                          81

seminarians to undertake this work, and a strong desire to work to
gain whatever was necessary to do this work." 257
       It is impossible to discover or recreate the spirit that informed
the L'viv, Stanyslaviv and Peremyshl' seminaries between the 1890s
and the 1930s. The facts adduced above provide only a hint of what
that spirit might have been like. Some idea may be gained, however,
in examining the attitudes of the seminarians themselves. The
sources provide a rather skewed picture of these attitudes, since they
mostly concern politics and the issue of priestly celibacy -- an issue
that involved spirituality and discipline as well as social and political
considerations. However, it was the semnarians' attitudes on
precisely these topics that determined in great part the
consciousness of the Greek-Catholic clergy between 1900 and 1939.

          CHAPTER TWO: STUDENT ATTITUDES
1. Politics and Society

       Even before the reform of the L'viv seminary, some of its
students at least were concerned with the social problems
confronting the Greek-Catholic clergy. Around 1897 the
announcement of a new secular publication, the Literaturno-
Naukovyi Vistnyk, to be edited by a board including Ivan Franko,
prompted a group of clerics from Oles'ko to publish a response in the
publication Dushpastyr. Franko, after all, was known for his anti-
clerical views. The Oles'ko clerics called on all priests belonging to
the Shevchenko Scholarly Society to prevent anti-religious articles
from being printed in the Vistnyk, or else to leave the Society. The
Reading-room Society at the L'viv seminary agreed with the Oles'ko
clerics, and sent a letter to that effect to the Society.258
       Whatever the outcome of this incident may have been, it
illustrates the L'viv seminarians' concern with meeting the
challenge posed by the lay intelligentsia. Their relationship with the
secular world, however, was not adverse in all respects. On the issue
of the creation of a "Ukrainian-Ruthenian" university, for example,
the seminarians saw eye to eye with their lay colleagues at the
University. In the academic year 1899-1900, which seminarian
Iaroslav Levyts'kyi considered "a significant year for the entire
Ukrainian youth," a public meeting on the university question was
held, Moloda Ukraina was published, and the secular student
hromada became "the heart of all young Ukrainians." "The
influence of the first viche [public meeting] and of the work of their
secular friends could not but affect the young theology students too,"
recalled Levyts'kyi a year later. There was intense activity as the
seminarians worked to improve themselves and each other. At the
Reading-room Circle there were discussions:
              The somnolence of the Ruthenian clergy was
           criticised -- its indifference to the newest trends
           hostile to the faith, its horror at the scholarly
           printed book, etc. The ideal, the goal of these
           Circle members was for the time being the
           hard-working candidate, proper in every respect,

           and in the future an even better Catholic priest
           and populist.259
       Not all these attitudes were shared by the rest of the
seminarians. The Russophiles had different concerns. Nor did all of
Galician society share the combination of Ukrainophile and Catholic
views held by Levyts'kyi and his colleagues. When official Russian
celebrations of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 1875 conversion of
the Uniates in the Kholm (Chehn) region to Orthodoxy sparked a
protest by the seminarians, the response in Ruthenian society was
mixed." Altogether few understood the action of the young theology
students (some did not even understand individual words and signs),
and almost nobody solidarised with jt."260
       In his 1913 memoir, the Rev. Osyp Ostashevs'kyi relates the
withdrawal of roughly 60 Russophile students from the Reading-
room around 1902. The Russophiles formed their own group,
profiting from the fact that the Ukrainophiles, objecting to the
rector's impartial stance, had alienated his favour. However, the
Russophiles soon annoyed the rector with their sympathies for Tsar
and Orthodoxy. During this time, "co-existence between the two
camps of seminarians was almost impossible." 261 After a Russophile
priest influenced a well-known specialist in moral theology to
denounce clerical celebrations of the Ukrainian national poet Taras
Shevchenko, the Reading-room had to reduce its activities.
Ostashevs'kyi and his colleagues were concerned about the spread of
Orthodoxy in Galicia through the work of Galician Russophiles and
through the sending of Galician children to "a school of janissaries
in autocratic Russia;" what annoyed them even more about the latter
was that it was Greek-Catholic priests who were responsible. All this
led to a major showdown between Ukrainians and Russophiles in the
seminary in 1912.262
       Ostashevs'kyi complains also about the apathy still common
among his fellows. Although a few activists revived the theological
club in 1913, "in reality not many showed up at the lectures, probably

259     Levytskyi 55-56. The Rev. Osyp Ostashevs'kyi remarks in 1913 that the
importance of the "ascetic world view" and of its dissemination is still too little
understood or valued by the Greek-Catholic clergy. Ostashevs'kyi, Osyp. "Z

                            84

 because by and large, the feeling for serious scholarly work still was
 not very great among them."263
       Yet neither their colleagues' apathy nor Russophile hostility
 could stem the growing political awareness of a number of the L'viv
 seminarians, which may have had its roots in secondary school (as
in the case of Myroslav Ripets'kyi) and in any case was nourished by
 contact with secular Ruthenians at the University (as related by
 Iaroslav Levyts'kyi). To a degree this political awareness, and later
 engagement, was a natural outgrowth of the dedication to their
people advocated by Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, who in his pastoral
letter of 1 September 1901 had directed the seminarians to come to
know their people and to care for their good, to love them and to
prepare thoroughly to work among them.264
       That same autumn the new dean of the faculty of theology at
the University, the Rev. Dr. Fialek, criticised the Ruthenian
seminarians for signing up for lectures in their own language, and
directed them to use only the Polish language in all oral or written
communications with the University authorities. This naturally
offended the seminarians, for as Osyp Ostashevs'kyi put it, "they
understood that their task was not only to be good seminarians but
also good defenders and fighters for the rights of their people."
Meeting on 20 November 1901, they resolved to ignore the dean's
demand; whoever should not heed their resolution would be shunned
by his comrades "as a traitor to the popular cause." After a
delegation to Dr. Fialek brought no results, they sent a memorandum
to the Ministry of Education and telegraphed the Ukrainian
parliamentary deputies in Vienna. 265 In the meantime, the secular
studentry had been provoked by the dean of the faculty of philosophy,
who had forbidden the historian Professor Mykhailo Hrushevs'kyi to
address faculty meetings in Ukrainian. 266 They called a meeting for
noon on the 19th of November. The time of day was chosen to
accommodate the seminarians, but had not been approved by the
authorities. Among the resolutions was a call for the creation of a

Ukrainian university in L'viv. During the ensuing march, the lay
students escorted their seminary brethren home and gave them a
parting ovation. All this elicited hostile articles in the press and anti-
Ukrainian leaflets. A few days after the demonstration, an inquiry
was held, as a result of which two students were expelled from the
University. In protest, several hundred Ukrainian students left the
University on 3 December 1901, not to return until July of the
following year.267
       Many of the "secessionists" -- by one account, half -- were
Greek-Catholic seminarians. 268 On hearing of this, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi informed the University rectorate that he was closing
the seminary on the next day. He provided financial support for his
students to continue their studies abroad. 269 Of these,160 transferred
to Vienna. Among them were losyf Botsiian, a future bishop; Tyt
Halushchyns'kyi, later a noted educator and Basilian
protoarchimandrite; and Ivan Liatyshevs'kyi, who was to become
suifragan bishop of Stanyslaviv.270
       After the secession of 1901-1902, conflicts divided the L'viv
seminarians from their lay colleagues. They decided at a general
meeting not to participate in a rally of Ruthenian students from all
over Austria to be held on 13-14 July1903, to protest against the
resolutions to be presented there, and to terminate relations with the
lay students altogether. They felt that the students had ceased to take
the seminarians' feelings into account and indeed had begun to
ignore them. As was evident from their publications Moloda
Ukraina and Iskra, they had taken a hostile stand with regard to the
seminarians. 271 Apparently, anti-clericalism had again come to the
fore.
       Yet the issue of Ukrainian-language chairs at the University
and related matters continued to provide common ground for lay and

seminary students. On 7 March 1906 the seminarians held a rally,
with the rector's approval, which sent a deputation to the academic
senate regarding violation of their linguistic rights, and demanding
a separate Ukrainian university. In December they demanded that
the academic senate permit them to take their oath of matriculation
in Ukrainian.272
      The lessons that the seminarians derived from this political
experience, as related by Ostashevs'kyi, were conditioned by their
peculiar status in Galician society:
             The illegality and coercion that we had long
           experienced, and the experience that the
           seminarians gained from common coexistence
           with the secular students during and after the
           secession, gave them an all too vivid proof of the
           fact that only by their own efforts and by the
           ceaseless labour of all those who were united by
           common principles, convictions and ideals,
           could they achieve something in good time, and
           for this reason the idea arose among them to
           organise our entire clergy and to set up an
           assistance fund in order to avert material need
           on behalf of young priests, and widows and
           orphans of priests.273

       The distancing of the L'viv seminarians from the highly
political secular studentry did not signify a retreat from politics. In
April 1908 the seminarians could only have joined Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi's condemnation of the assassination of Viceroy Potocki
by a Ukrainian student. Yet in that same year, a group of Polish
landowners wrote to the new Galician viceroy, the historian Micha
Bobrzyzski, complaining that Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's seminary
graduates were becoming less and less Christian. 274 In 1910 there
were bloody Polish-Ukrainian university disorders, particularly on 1
July. On 28 June, Sheptyts'kyi had made a speech in the House of
Lords in favour of a Ukrainian university, thus lending his prestige
to the cause. Nevertheless, in December, in the spirit of a papal

decree, the Metropolitan Ordinariat forbade the reading of political
periodicals in the seminary.275
       The Ukrainian orientation of at least a substantial number of
the L'viv seminarians implied an interest in political events beyond
the confines of Galicia. Osyp Ostashevs'kyi relates that the
seminarians sought "to awaken their brothers from the other side of
the Carpathians, and together with them to stand beneath the blue-
and-yellow banner of Ukraine." Events in Russian Ukraine
interested them too. "Recently the chains of our people have been
broken," writes Ostashevs'kyi in 1913; "recently the bright sun has
risen upon the horizon of Ukraine and with its rays has pierced the
fogs of servitude, and today we bear witness to the great strides that
this people has made in such a brief time in the development of its
life." On the eve of the world war that would see the establishment of
a short-lived Ukrainian state, Ostashevs'kyi expresses the conviction
that the Greek-Catholic clergy would have an important role to play
in Ukrainian nation-building: "Today it is the desire of our people to
come up to the level of healthy western European culture; th a great
degree this task lies also upon the clergy; therefore a zeal for
energetic work for the people and the Catholic Church must grow
within us, and future generations will speak of its success."276
       The political efforts of the Galician Ruthenians towards
electoral reform and a Ukrainian university proved successful only
in1914, when there was too little time to profit from their victory.
Their general impetus, of course, found expression in the
establishment of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic in the
autumn of 1918, and in the bitter Polish-Ukrainian war of the next
several months. Seminary life was interrupted, with many former
and future seminarians taking part in that struggle.277
       With the establishment of the Polish state, the L'viv seminary
came under official suspicion along with other Ukrainian
institutions. Nykolai Voiakovs'kyi, a L'viv seminarian ordained in
1925, recounts that one evening in the early 1920s the seminary
rector told him that the police planned to search the seminary for a

 cache of arms supposedly kept there by the conspiratorial Ukrainian
 Military Organisation, and asked him and a colleague to check the
 cellar. Voiakovs'kyi's search produced nothing save a dead cat, and
 the police never arrived. 278 In January 1924 the L'viv police chief
 wrote to the county governor, listing details concerning the political
loyalty of fourteen professors at the Greek-Catholic seminary, such
 as their political activity, party affiliations, contacts with the
underground Ukrainian university, and such.279 In December 1930
the governor of Ternopil' county informed his counterpart in L'viv
 (with copies to the ministries of Cults and Internal Affairs) that at
the L'viv seminary or St. George's Cathedral, a commission of
Ukrainian scholars was assembling information about that year's
pacification, to be published abroad. 280 A report to the Ministry of
Religious Cults and Public Education on Greek-Catholic clerical
agitation in favour of Carpatho-Ukraine in 1938-1939 listed four
former students of the Minor Seminary or Academy who had been
arrested and sentenced for subversive activity between 1931 and 1938,
noting that there were "many others." It also listed five current
residents of the seminary who had been sentenced for activity in the
Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists. 281 Undoubtedly the flood of
applicants unable to obtain either a job or an education elsewhere in
the 1930s imported elements into the L'viv seminary whose
orientation was more political than metaphysical. In any case, the
atmosphere was apparently so intense that according to a note of the
religious section of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of 2 August 1938
concerning a seminary for the Lemko region, "It cannot be doubted
that even a stay of a few days in Ukrainian nationalist centres, such
as the Seminaries in L'viv and Peremyshl', can exert a markedly
negative influence on immature seminarians, and this situation
must be avoided."282
       The excitement over Carpatho-Ukrainian autonomy affected
the L'viv seminary in more ways than one. On the eve of 1 November

(the traditional day of celebration of the Western Ukrainian People's
Republic and the battle for L'viv) 1938, a mob attacked several
Ukrainian institutions in the city, destroying the seminary's
entrance gate, reception room and two adjoining rooms.283
       The students' political convictions put the seminary
administration in a delicate position. The Rev. Volodymyr Pelekh
recounts that when, as a second-year seminarian, he was called for
military registration around 1932 or 1933, he refused to speak with
the officer in Polish, and was duly arrested. On the next day the
rector, Rev. losyf Slipyj, had to come to liberate him and after some
pertractations with the military authorities obtained an exemption
based on physical disability for his perfectly healthy charge.284
       The extent of nationalist convictions among the L'viv
seminarians of the inter-war period is difficult to quantify, but it is
relevant that the old acrimonious party divisions between
Russophiles and Ukrainians were a thing of the past. Pelekh relates
that in his time (1931-1936), "Common life among the students was
pleasant and civilised..."285
       In 1901 the L'viv seminarian Iaroslav Levyts'kyi wrote, "...we
have hope in God that our seminary will some day be an example for
other institutions." 286 Did the seminarians of Peremyshi' and
Stanyslaviv follow their L'viv colleagues in the development of their
attitudes?
       Aside from the celibacy issue, which will be discussed below,
there is no readily available information on prevailing attitudes in
the Stanyslaviv seminary. 287 There is not much more regarding
Peremyshl'. 288 An unsigned, undated manuscript, evidently

provides one Peremyshi' seminarian's views on the role of future
Greek-Catholic priests. Apparently dating from the early or mid-
1930s, this essay paints a picture of a world full of strife, in which the
Church finds itself embattled. In such a situation, writes the author,
priests cannot remain passive. Like Osyp Ostashevs'kyi in his 1913
essay, thiB seminarian calls on his fellows to accelerate their activity
so that they may catch up with the peoples of western Europe.
Specifically, they must "restructure society" and so direct public
opinion as to make Christian tenets prevail in all public and private
institutions. In this they must enlist the aid of the laity -- in accord
with the principles of the "Catholic Action" movement -- since the
activity of priests is often perceived as a mere defence of their
professional interests. The author next analyses the mass-
psychological reasons for the success of anti-Christian ideologies,
which appeal to human weaknesses and passions. In order to
promote the more demanding principles of Christianity, the clergy
must expose the terrible effects of false principles. Only a priesthood
trained for this spiritual battle will be able to accomplish this:
             The cause of Christ requires true soldiers who
          would go forth in life without looking back.
          Therefore, may our motto for now be to educate
          ourselves to be such soldiers of Christ, so that
          some day we might join battle with Christ's
          enemies.289

       This essay reflects Roman Catholic movements of the time,
such as Catholic Action. It also appears to reflect the position of those
Greek-Catholic priests who were attracted by the heroic ideal but
held back from involvement in nationalist politics, which by that time
had become coloured by an ideology that some considered
inconsistent with Christianity, let alone Catholicism (see Chapter
Eight, Section 2).
       However, as the above-quoted note of the Ministry of Internal
Affairs would indicate, the Peremyshl' seminary was not lacking in
Ukrainian nationalist activity. At the same time, the Polish
authorities exerted considerable pressure on the Church as a whole
to behave loyally. In June 1939 the rector of the Peremyshi' seminary,
the Rev. Ivan Kuzych, was fined 50 zloty for refusing to hang the

Polish flag over the seminary building on the Third of May. In a
letter to the town authorities, he disavowed any lack of respect for the
state, pointing out that the regulation in question had not been
enforced in previous years.29°
        There was barely enough time between the creation of the
Lemko Apostolic Administration in 1934 and the close of the period
under study for the separate education of priests intended for that
jurisdiction. However, documents concerning the Lemko
seminarians at Cracow, Tarndw and Dubno reveal the conflicts that
occasionally arose between the attitudes of the students and the
requirements of both seminary administration and government
authorities.
        The government recognised that future priests for the Lemko
Apostolic Administration could not properly be educated in Latin-rite
seminaries such as those at Cracow and Tarnow, where they could
not study the Eastern rite. There was a need for a special seminary
for the Lemko region, preferably in Sanok. As noted above, the
Ministry for Internal Affairs would not tolerate sending these Lemko
candidates to the L'viv or Peremyshi' seminaries, which were
hotbeds of Ukrainian nationalism. 291 in August of 1938 an official of
the Cracow governor's office persuaded the Apostolic Administrator,
the Rev. Iakiv Medvets'kyi, to agree to send some students to Tarnów,
where they would study in an environment conducive to education in
a religious and state spirit, far from the Ukrainian influences which
had already reached students as far away as Cracow. 292 In October,
the Cracow governor sent details of the moral and political
characteristics of the nine applicants for Tarnow to the Ministry of
Religious Cults and Public Education, with a copy to the Ministry of
Internal Affairs (Political department, nationalities section). Eight of
the candidates, who were morally sound and had exhibited no strong
political interests, were deemed acceptable, even though only one
adhered to Old Ruthenian convictions, whilst two sympathised with
the Ukrainian National-Democratic Union and one had an older
brother suspected of OUN membership. The ninth, however, had
been expelled from the Czstochowa Seminary in Cracow "as a
decided Ukrainian chauvinist, burning with hatred for everything

that is Polish and that is connected with the Roman Catholic rite."
He desired to carry on destructive, anti-Polish work among the
seminarians, and therefore must not be accepted. Thus eight
candidates destined for the Lemko region would be accepted at
Tarnów, in addition to three students accepted in the previous year
and five presently at Cracow, for a total of sixteen.293

2. Celibacy
        Throughout the period under study but particularly after 1918,
Greek-Catholic seminarians were faced with an issue that had deep
social, political and cultural as well as spiritual implications and
became the subject of the greatest controversy both within and
without the Greek-Catholic Church in the inter-war period. This was
the question of mandatory priestly celibacy. It will be discussed in
connection with the Western church cultural orientation in Chapter
Eight; inasmuch as it primarily concerned the seminarians,
however, its beginnings will be traced here.
        On Annunciation Day 1910, Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn gave
a sermon following liturgy in the Stanyslaviv seminary chapel in
which he stressed the need for celibate priests in the Greek-Catholic
Church. After this there was a call for volunteers, and at the end of
the year three seminarians agreed to be ordained celibate. 294 In 1918,
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi reserved half the places in his seminary
for candidates intending to be ordained as celibates. In 1920 the
bishops of all three Greek-Catholic eparchies in Galicia decided in
favour of a celibate clergy. The Stanyslaviv eparchy was immediately
affected, and by 1924 married candidates in L'viv and Peremyshi'
were experiencing difficulties in obtaining ordination. The lay
intelligentsia mostly opposed priestly celibacy, seeing it as a means of
latinisation, polonisation, and destruction of the social and biological
sources of the intelligentsia itself. When in 1925 the first and second
year students of the Peremyshi' eparchy were told that they would
not be ordained married, there was a massive secession. Similar
events had taken place in Stanyslaviv. In the L'viv archeparchy,
however, celibacy was never required of all candidate priests.295

       According to an anonymous brochure published in 1929, the
 Ruthenian Provincial Synod of 1891 had rejected a surprise
 resolution advocating compulsory celibacy and had instead approved
 a counter-resolution praising priestly celibacy but leaving the choice
 up to each individual seminarian. However, the version of the
 Synod's decisions approved by the Holy See in 1895 and published in
 1896 was somewhat altered in favour of celibacy, supposedly as a
 result of Cardinal Ledá chowski's pressure upon Metropolitan
 Sylvester Sembratovych. 296 Be that as it may, in his pastoral letter of
 31 August 1918 concerning the reservation of places over the next 12
years for seminarians committed to ordination as celibates,
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi declared that he needed celibate priests,
primarily to evangelise Orthodox Ukraine, and recommended that
prefects and catechists should preach the evangelical counsel of
lifelong purity. He also made it clear that celibacy must not be
coerced. 297 It was Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's intention, as he
reportedly explained to a lay delegation on 9 September 1918, that
there should be in effect two seminaries, one for celibates and one for
future married priests. He assured the delegation that he intended to
educate only a part of the candidates as celibates, and that he
disfavoured compulsion in this matter.298
       At the L'viv conference attended by Archbishop-Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi, Bishop Khomyshyn and Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi in the
autumn of 1920, however, a decision reportedly was made to impose
celibacy on all candidate priests. This decision was kept secret until
1922, when the Rev. Ivan Liatyshevs'kyi, future auxiliary bishop of
Stanyslaviv, revealed it in a newspaper article. 299 By then, Bishop
Khomyshyn had already re-opened his seminary (in 1920) declaring
that he would only ordain celibates, and in May 1921 had expelled five

 fourth-year seminarians who had wished to delay ordination to make
 up their minds about celibacy. In December 1921 five seminarians
 had agreed to be ordained sub-deacons in the celibate state on two
 days' notice, but four who hesitated had been removed.300
        Evhen Ren, a former seminarian at Stanyslaviv who left in
  1925 over the celibacy issue, recalled over fifty years later that he and
 his colleagues had found Bishop Khomyshyn's arguments for
 celibacy insubstantial, unrealistic and rather severe, all the more so
 because they all looked forward to marriage and family life.301
 However, the Rev. Petro Mel'nychuk recounts that it was outside
 influences that prompted some of the seminarians to declare a strike
 against compulsory celibacy. Only several deacons (who were no
 longer eligible to marry) remained in the seminary, along with a few
 lower-class students who were promptly dubbed traitors. Mel'nychuk
 explains the limited duration of the secession by the fact that many of
 the seminarians were eligible for military service once they left the
 seminary, and could only avoid conscription by returning -- although
 he adds that many became confirmed in their vocations at that time.
 He himself was recruited into the army, but on the day before he was
to take the military oath he received a friendly note from Bishop
Khomyshyn inviting him to return to the seminary. After the strike,
the moral atmosphere as well as material conditions improved.302
       Evhen Ren corroborates the thesis that the anti-celibacy
movement among the seminarians was inspired from outside. He
adds that the organisers of the Stanyslaviv secession approached the
Rev. Havryil Kostel'nyk, a professor at the L'viv seminary and a
leader of the "Byzantinists," for a show of solidarity by the
seminarians there, but were refused on the ground that celibacy was
not being enforced in L'viv. "Nearly all" left the Stanyslaviv
seminary, according to Ren, but soon Bishop Khomyshyn's
arguments began to take their effect, and for many (though not for
Ren) they prevailed over the anti-celibacy propaganda then prevalent
in Ukrainian Galician society. The Bishop continued lectures
regardless of the number of students attending, and gradually the
halls were filled again. For some the choice was not easy: one student

left and returned to the seminary three times, but ultimately was
ordained.303
       In the Peremyshi' eparchy, the mostly lay campaign against
the introduction of compulsory priestly celibacy in 1925 was the brunt
of a general attack on the person of Bishop losafat Kotsylovs'kyi. In a
28-point complaint signed onl4 December 1926 by 40 laymen and sent
to Pope Pius XI and the Sacred Congregation for the Eastern
Churches, the Bishop was accused of ignoring the normal selection
process for seminarians and entrusting the task to one of the
youngest canons -- a celibate -- who allegedly chose candidates solely
according to their willingness to be ordained celibate. As a result, the
first- and second-year students constituted 'a motley crew of all
kinds of beggars and helpless youths. The complaint continues:
              Today,only those volunteer for the clerical
           state who do not have the material means to
          enroll at the university, and wishing to be
          accepted at the theological seminary, swear to
          celibacy and in their youthful lack of judgment
          they violate their consciences, while the Bishop
          prides himself, for after all the candidate
          volunteered to be celibate. Such celibates are an
          object of jest and ridicule among the mass of the
          faithful, current while among the current
          seminarians hypocrisy and cynicism have
          become widespread to an alarming extent.304
      The anonymous author of a 1927 brochure reprinted in 1929
asserts that the imposition of celibacy in Peremyshl' and Stanyslaviv
has lowered the level of the seminarians in those institutions:
             ..While in the L'viv archeparchy a
          Theological Academy is founded, studies are
          increased to a five-year programme, and the best
          scholarly forces are chosen [to teachj, in
          Peremyshl' the level of knowledge is being
          systematically lowered. Young prefects lacking
          scholarly preparation and experience, whose
          only qualification is their celibacy, are being
          called to lecture. And in no time a twin clergy
          will begin to appear in Galicia: in L'viv, one
          with a higher education, as it should be -- in
          Stanyslaviv and Peremyshl', one with [only] a
          school-boy' s "bluffing".

      He goes on to point out that Emperor Joseph II gave the L'viv
seminary not to the bishops but to the Ukrainian people, for its
cultural elevation. The imposition of celibacy in the seminaries is
depriving the people of the kind of priests they have a right to
demand:
                And today, what will Ukraine get out of
          some of the eparchial seminaries created at the
          expense of Joseph's L'viv seminary and
          perverted by celibacy? Will the people get
          Shashkevyches, Ustiianovyches,
          Mohyl 'nyts'kyis, Kachalas, Taniachkevyches,
          Nehrebets'kyis, etc. from them? Oo the bishops
          have unlimited rights to these seminaries?
          Formally they have rights. Morally they do not.
          And the matter of the designation of the
          seminaries and the education of spiritual
          leaders shall remain forever a matter that is not
          strictly ecclesiastical, but a common
          ecclesiastical-popular matter. For these young
          forces are being prepared not for Africa, but
          rather for their own people. And after all it is
          the people that is building these seminaries and
          is supporting the seminarians and the clergy,
          with its taxes and with its bread, and it has a
          right to find out who they are, these leaders, and
          what they are bringing to it.306

       It may well be that Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's reform of the
seminary at the beginning of the century created high expectations
among Ukrainian Galician lay society, subjecting the seminarians to
greater public scrutiny. No longer dismissed as narrow-minded
parasite, by the 1920s the seminarian was expected to become a
national leader. The development of his attitudes over this period tells
something of the degree to which the seminary prepared him to meet
these expectations. In this development, the "spirit of the institution"
as it evolved at L'viv, Stanyslaviv and Peremyshi' played no small
role. This spirit developed in the direction of a general consensus on
the questions of national identity (see Chapter Six) and ths leading
role of the priest in Ukrainian society (see Chapter Eight). On more
specific issues such as compulsory celibacy and party politics,
seminarians would remain divided after ordination (see Chapters
Six and Seven).

3.Discovering th West

      Another dimension in the education of the Greek-Catholic
clergy between the 1890s and the 1930s is represented by those who
studied abroad. The secession from the L'viv seminary in 1901-1902
was the first instance of mass study abroad, but small numbers of
Ruthenian seminarians were studying in central and western
Europe well before this time. 307 For example, in 1879 the Peremyshi'
eparchy had two students in Rome (presumably at the Greek Co'lege)
and eleven at the Greek Catholic Central Seminary in Vienna (closed
in 1893). 308 In 1897, nine students from the L'viv archeparchy were
studying at the Greek College in Rome and three who were already
ordained were at the St. Augustine Institute in Vienna (closed in
1918). In that same year, two students from the Stanyslaviv eparchy
were in Rome, though a stipend for a third was available, while one
(namely, the future Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn) was at the St.
Augustine Institute. 309 Also in 1897, twelve students of the Greek
College were transferred to the new Ruthenian seminary in another
part of Rome. About 28 students from the three Galician eparchies
studied there from 1897 through 1900. The seminary was run by
Jesuits until 1904, when the Basilians took over. It was closed
because of the war in 1915, re-opened in 1921, and moved in 1932 to a
location near the Propaganda Fide university, where many of the
students took courses. From then it was known as St. Josaphat's
College. In the inter-war period, its Galician students found
themselves in the company of Ruthenian or Ukrainian students from
Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Brazil, Canada, the United

Galician eparchies in 1932.310
        Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi encouraged his brighter students to
study abroad, and provided scholarships. Some attended the
Canisianum in Innsbruck, others studied at Fribourg, Graz, Liege,
Louvain, Munich, Paris, Salzburg, Strasbourg, etc. 311 In 1932, for
example, the L'viv archeparchy had five seminarians at St.
Josaphat's College in Rome, two in Warsaw, and one each in Vienna,
Innsbruck, and at the Biblicum in Rome.312
        Seminary graduates were also encouraged to pursue further
studies, particularly if they wished to teach at the seminaries. Many
sought doctorates at Vienna. 313 Others continued their studies in
Poland. Because the Polish authorities required catechists and
secondary school teachers to have attended Polish universities, each
year from 1934 the metropolitan would send two students who had
completed the Academy course for further studies at the University
of L'viv.314
        Seminary education abroad, especially on the graduate level,
produced an elite of scholars, seminary professors, and high church
officials. It also acquainted students with western Catholic culture,
and made the Greek-Catholic Church better known in the West.
Study abroad left strong impressions on the participants in the
secession of 190 1-1902. Osyp Ostashevs'kyi wrote:
              The seminarians' stay abroad, in great
           cultural centres, prepared among them a fertile

           in Vienna, positively affected our seminarians'
           change of world view. They saw how our
           intelligentsia in general had accepted western
           civilisation, but only that civilisation that was
           far from the fundamentals of Christ's teaching;
           they were aware that such culture brings ruin
           and not good for our society. In such
           circumstances, the young theologians
           understood that above all, it must adopt Catholic
           religious ideas from the West and with them, to
           colour the national and social aspects of our
           people's life, and thus to react against the dark
           forces of growing faithlessness.315
       The secessionists were, however, a special case. In 1916 a
priest writing in Nyva criticised candidates returning from
foreignstudies. They may be pious and learned, he concedes, but they
make poor pastors and teachers of the people. For in the West, they
have become alienated from their Church and from their people's
rites and customs -- indeed, from the people themselves. They have
no regard for those things "that every sincere Ukrainian treasures."
Although they may obtain high positions in the church hierarchy,
they cannot influence the people bIuse they have become estranged
from them and from their culture.316
       This last observation illustrates some of the dangers of overly
rapid assimilation of foreign cultural values, and foreshadows the
conflicts of the inter-war period. In these conflicts, parish priests
sometimes found common cause with the laity in criticising the
policies of their foreign-educated bishops. The parish clergy were
nearly all trained in the three Galician seminaries, where they could
benefit from the improvements in education while maintaining their
ties with the village, keeping a balance between native cultural
values and those borrowed from the West. Even those who then went
on to study abroad were not likely to abandon that perspective.317
       The improvements in primary, secondary and seminary
education for Ruthenians and Ukrainians between the last two
decades of the nineteenth century and the two deèádes between the
world wars helped to train a clergy prepared to deal with the difficult
choices and challenges that faced them between 1900 and 1939.

Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's seminary reform in particular sought to
educate a new priesthood capable of evangelising the East as well as
regaining the lead in Ukrainian society. To what extent the Greek-
Catholic parish clergy accepted these tasks will be explored in
Chapters Six through Eight. First, however, it is necessary to
examine the social and economic context in which the newly
ordained priest found himself when he arrived at his first parish.
             PART TWO: THE PRIEST IN SOCIETY
        CHAPTER THREE: THE LEGAL, ECONOMIC
           AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONTEXT
1. The Austrian Period

      The Austrian Concordat and various ecclesiastical laws
governed the affairs of the Greek-Catholic Church in Galicia up to
1918 and to a certain extent under the Polish administration
thereafter.

                                                    Assignment to a Parish

        After ordination, a priest would be assigned to his first parish.
In Peremyshl', the official eparchial journal listed parishes for
which a competition was to be held. 318 In order to be allowed to apply
for vacant benefices, priests had to pass periodic examinations in
theology. 319 Upon being assigned to a parish, a priest signed a
statement attesting that he was not indulging in simony. He also had
to make a formal confession of faith. Like all Catholic priests at the
time, he had to take an oath denouncing Modernism, the heresy of
modifying the Church's teaching to conform to the findings of
natural and historical science.320
       A decree of the Austrian court chancery of 1786 provided for
the rights of a patron (colator) of a parish church to participate in the
selection of the parish priest. 321 Generally, the eparchial bishop
would nominate three candidates for a vacant benefice. The patron,
exercising the ius prezenty, would then choose one of the three. He
had to exercise this right within four months. 322 Typically, the
patron of a parish would be a local Polish landowner.

       The state could also influence the choice of a priest for a given
benefice. Under the law of 7 May 1874, the state had thirty days to
object to an appointment. 323 If the state did not object, then the
candidate chosen by the patron (if any) would be canonically
instituted in the benefice by the bishop. He could not subsequently be
removed from the parish, except for good cause. If he became ill, an
assistant could be nominated, but the parish priest would retain the
ius ad rem or right to the benefice. If he died, an administrator
would be appointed temporarily in his place. The administrator
could be removed, and was obligated to pay rent to the consistory for
the parish lands.324

                                                          Salary (Congrua)

       The financial basis for the Church under Austria was the
Religious Fund, established by decree in 1782 from the property of
dissolved monasteries; later, the Fund drew on other sources. There
was a separate Religious Fund for Galicia, managed by the civil
authorities. Benefice holders paid dues into the Fund, in proportion
to the estimated wealth of the benefice.325
       In Austrian Galicia, parish priests received income from
various sources. The laws established a "congrual" system, intended
to secure a single basic salary for all priests. Each year, a priest
would submit an account of his fixed income from all sources
(including rents and sacramental fees), as well as of his expenses
(including taxes), to the civil authorities. If his net income did not
come up to the basic amount, the difference would be made up by a
supplement from the State Religious Fund. If it exceeded the basic
amount, the excess would be returned to the state. Under the law of
1898, the basic amount varied according to the size of the community;
assistant priests or vicars received a smaller amount. 326 Under a

law of 1907, after every five years of pastoral work the priest's income
would be raised by 100 crowns, up to forty years' service. Retirement
pay (under the 1898 law) was increased correspondingly up to the
amount of 2000 crowns. These increases would be paid out of the
Religious Fund, except to the extent that they were covered by the
priest's sacramental fees.327
       Austrian law distinguished between church property and
benefice property. Under a law of 1874, the parochial or church
property was to be held by a local committee consisting of the parish
priest, the patron, and the representative of the community.328
However, because of the Galician bishops' failure to issue
appropriate instructions, the strict separation of church property
from benefice property was never effected in that province.
Nevertheless, the state did retain the right to examine the finances of
vacant benefices, to make inventories of property land income, and
generally to supervise the parish economy.329
       The Austrian law of 7 May 1874 dealt among other things with
the troublesome matter of sacramental fees (iura stolae or Stol-Taxe).
The amounts of the fees for baptisms, weddings, funerals, and so on
had been regulated in Austrian Galicia at various times from the
late eighteenth century. 330 As will be seen below, they remained a
source of conflict between priest and parish to the end of the period
under study.
       Despite the guarantees of Austrian law, some priests felt that
their general economic condition left much to be desired. In 1902 a
priest writing in a secular newspaper complained bitterly that the
consistory did not concern itself with the poverty of parish priests. "It
seems," he wrote, "that in the entire Catholic world there is no clergy
so helpless and neglected as our Ruthenian Catholic clergy, which in
addition is burdened by family obligations." 33' (The economic liability
of a married clergy would become a major argument of proponents of
compulsory priestly celibacy, discussed below and in Chapter Seven.)

of the Society of St. Andrew in L'viv in 1935, observed that before the
war, Greek-Catholic priests had been largely self-sufficient.332
       The condition of the parish clergy was aggravated by the
military operations of World War I, which wrought economic ruin in
what was already one of Europe's poorest provinces. In 1918 the
episcopal ordinariat of the Peremyshi' eparchy collected reports of
the economic state of the parishes in various deaneries. The acting
dean of Mushyna reported that no parish in his deanery possessed
property worth over 20,000 crowns. In this mountainous region the
land, which was the priests' main source of income, was poor. War
losses reported by the parishes included confiscation of bells as well
as material damage to rectories. All but one of the 26 parish priests
had reported that they would not be able to survive if the state went
ahead with its planned nationalisation of 20-30% of their property.
Similarly, the dean at Sokal' reported that all his parishes had
suffered property damage during the war, in an average amount of
10% of the property's value. All but four of the eighteen parishes in
the Sambir deanery had suffered damage, and all required repairs or
new construction. All nine parishes of the Olkhivtsi deanery had
suffered war damage and required repairs, and none of the parish
priests received income up to the level of the state-guaranteed basic
amount. The dean of Iavoriv stated that despite the poor quality of the
land, which was sandy, all the priests' income was based on it, since
one could not count on the poverty-stricken parishioners for much
support. All 27 parishes received an income below the basic amount.
During the war, church and parish property had been damaged to
an average extent of 50% in all parishes. 333 As late as 1929, 41
churches in the Peremyshl' eparchy that had been destroyed, mostly
in the war, had not been rebuilt (compared to 1290 existing
churches).334

                                                      Church Administration

      The Greek Catholic parish priest could count on visitations by
his dean and, more rarely, by his bishop and even the metropolitan.
In the Peremyshi' eparchy, deans were required to send reports of

 their annual visitations to the Episcopal Ordinariat every
January. 335 Canonical visitations were the subject of a 1902 pastoral
letter of Metropolitan Andrei Sheptyts'kyi to the clergy of all three
 eparchies. Promising to visit five parishes in each deanery, the
 metropolitan warned that he could tell whether a parish priest had
prepared for the visitation only in the last few days, weeks or months.
He pointed out that both the material and the spiritual side of parish
work were important: chalices had to be gilded and vestments
 cleaned, but at the same time the priest had to make sure that adults
 as well as children really understood the faith. He would be able to
divine this from the confessions of the faithful that he would hear
during his visitation. In addition, he desired to hear a typical
sermon, and thus saw no need to designate the preacher far in
advance. The sermon would also serve to tell him much about the
quality of the pastoral work being carried out.336
       In a 1905 pastoral letter to the clergy of the Stanyslaviv
eparchy, Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn informed them that during
visitations he would judge their work with primary attention to
sermons and catechesis. In particular, he would verify whether they
had made the faithful and the youth aware of the Church's basic
principles and given them an understanding of Christ in the
mystery of the Eucharist.337
       Deans, too, conducted parish visitations. In the Peremyshl'
eparchy, a dean communicated his results to the episcopal consistory
on a prepared form. One such form printed in 1914 consisted of four
pages including questions on such matters as the pastor himself, the
condition of the church and other parish buildings, pastoral work
(with 23 questions to be asked of the parishioners), the state of parish
records, the treasury, and the teaching of religion in the local school.
A more elaborate and probably later form ran to 12 pages and
included additional questions on church brotherhoods and the
assistant priest, if any.338

       In his pastoral letter of 1902 cited above, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi promised to try to attend a meeting of parish clergy in
every deanery. These meetings, known as soborchvky, were to be held
at the end of every canonical visitation. 339 The L'viv Archiepiscopal
Synod of 1897 had set down regulations on the holding of deanery
meetings. As adopted at the Peremyshi' Eparchial Council of 1898,
these rules required three such meetings to be held yearly in each
deanery, though a mission could be substituted for one of these. The
programme was to be decided by the dean, but one written and one
oral presentation must be given at each meeting, for the education of
the priests. The topics could be theological, pastoral, practical,
historical, etc., but political topics and those that might offend must
be avoided. The younger priests would be the first to give talks. The
official report of the Peremyshl' Council stressed the need for
continuing clerical education:
              Truly, today more than ever the pastor cannot
           stand in one place on the road of knowledge, but
           as a representative of his lofty vocation, as a
           teacher and leader of the people, absolutely must
           progress constantly in the field of learning.. P340

       The 1898 regulations were not universally heeded. Bishop
Konstantyn Chekhovych of Peremyshl' sent a circular to his deans
on 9 November 1905 complaining that some of them had not reported
the proceedings of their deanery meetings to the Episcopal
Ordinariat for years.341
      Extraordinary deanery meetings were ordered by the
Peremyshl' episcopal ordinariat in 1912. The deans met in
Peremyshl' on 24 January, apparently to discuss priestly solidarity
and the danger of schism. Deans then sent circulars to their clergy
announcing the extraordinary deanery meetings, at which they
would read the bishops' joint pastoral letters of 13 February 1905 on
solidarity in pastoral work, of 11 January 1906 on conduct in public

                                                Secular Administration

       The parish priest's relations with the government and local
administration frequently involved his duty of keeping records of
births and deaths. At the meeting of the Komarno deanery on 7 May
1900, it was noted that the local authorities in Rudky had asked that
in military matters, parish offices should provide extracts from
parish records in the German language. A Fr. Onyshkevych moved
that the priests should continue to provide extracts in the Ruthenian
language, as provided by law, and if the authorities objected, they
should appeal the matter to the highest levels. The motion was
approved unanimously.343
       The language of parish extracts and of the records themselves
became a bone of contention between the parish priest and the local
authorities, who in most cases were Polish. In 1912 Fr. A. Holinatyi
wrote in to the clerical journal Nyva relating his experiences with
the district court in Nove Selo. He noted that theretofore, parish
offices had received forms for death certificates in the Ruthenian
language. A few days earlier, however, Fr. Holinatyi had received
Polish-language forms. He returned them to the court, which
responded with a letter explaining that as a state record office, the
parish office must correspond with other authorities in the Polish
language. Fr. Holinatyi complained to Nyva that not all Ruthenian
priests were insisting on using their own language in such
instances. He suggested that if the Ruthenian language were indeed
disallowed in parish records, Ruthenian given names should be
written in Latin transcription -- but not Latin translation -- for
example, "Volodymyr" but not "Vladimirus." 344 As discussed below,
such technical matters would become the subjects of heated
controversy under Polish rule.

       Under the Polish Republic, Austrian legislation remained in
effect until new laws were promulgated, but was never entirely
superseded. A decree of the Council of Ministers published on 25
March 1933 listed Austrian laws no longer in effect by virtue of their
inconsistency with the 1925 Polish Concordat; most of these
concerned property.345
         The Polish Constitution of 1921 provided for freedom of
conscience and the equality of religious groups. However, the Roman
Catholic faith was first among equals, and the Church enjoyed
internal autonomy. These provisions were re-enacted in the
Constitution of 1935. The Concordat of 1925 gave the state authorities
only a minor influence on church affairs, allowing the Catholic
Church considerable freedom of action and internal administration.
Although Pilsudski's regime and its successors included many
secularising politicians who were far from pro-clerical, on the whole
the government honoured the provisions of both Constitution and
Concordat.346
       The Concordat rendered the clergy immune from military
service, legal prosecution in the civil courts, and personal income
tax. It allowed them to conduct the religious education that was
compulsory in state schools. Their salaries were funded from the
property originally confiscated by the partitioning powers, which had
passed to the Polish government after 1918.
       The Greek-Catholic bishops did not participate in the
preparatory work or negotiations for the Concordat, and the
Ukrainians in Poland were generally dissatisfied with the
document. 348 In the event, however, the Concordat was not fully put
into practice, as some differences between government and Church
remained unresolved.349
       Article 19 re-established the ius praenotificationis, entitling
the government to object to the appointment of a priest to a benefice if

this should be contrary to state security. Under article 20, in such a
case the bishop would have three months to decide whether to
remove the priest. Should the bishop disagree with the government,
the case would be referred to a committee of two priests and two
representatives of the President. 350 In practice, the Greek-Catholic
bishops circumvented the government's right to object to an
appointment by nominating administrators or transferring priests
from parish to parish. In the 1920s, the L'viv governor was disturbed
by the government's inability to prevent the Greek-Catholic bishops
from transferring nationalist priests from small parishes to
politically significant ones. 351 However, according to one source, it
was generally accepted by the end of the inter-war period that the jj
praenotificationis applied to transfers as well as to appointments of
newly ordained priests. 352 In any case, the placement of Greek-
Catholic priests remained a constant source of tension between
Church and state, and confirmation was often refused or removal
demanded where the priest advocated separate status for the
Ukrainians .353
       In the L'viv county (wojewddtw), once the patron had made
his selection from among the candidates proposed by the bishop, the
approval of the county would be sent to the Ministry of Religious
Cults. In the case of Fr. Hryhorii Fukan'chyk, whom the Bishop of
Peremyshi' sought to nominate to a parish in Uhertsi (Lisko district)
in 1933, the governor objected under article 19 of the Concordat
because during his tenure as administrator of that parish, Fr.
Fukan'chyk had "made himself known as an intractable foe of the
Polish State and People, and with his activity has made impossible
the peaceable co-existence of the population of both nationalities."
These assertions were based on detailed representations by the
district starostwa in Lisko. The circumstances were rather unusual,
since the patron had apparently lost possession of the property and
could not exercise the ius prezent y. The Bishop favoured Fr.
Fukan'chyk despite the fact that older priests -- who were allegedly

more loyal to Poland -- had applied for the benefice. Yet it appears
that the Minister of Cults did not find the evidence of Fr.
Fukan'chyk's anti-Polish activity sufficient to establish a threat to
state security, and declined to oppose the nomination. 354 In 1939 the
Apostolic Administrator for the Lemko region sought to install Fr.
Ivan Fenych, parish priest at Voikova in the Nowy Scz district, at
Senkova Volia in the Sianyk (Sanok) district. Passing information
from the administration at Nowy Scz about Fr. Fenych's Ukrainian
nationalist activity, his hostile attitude to the Polish state and his
previous troubles with the law to the Minister of Religious Cults, the
Cracow governor nevertheless stated that under the Ministry's
January 1929 guidelines for application of articles 19 and 20 of the
Concordat, he could not formally protest the priest's nomination to
the benefice. Indeed, the governors in Galicia in the late 1920s and
1930s interpreted the Concordat narrowly regarding threats to state
security, and protests against nominations of Greek-Catholic priests
to benefices were the exception, even in cases where the priest held
Ukrainian nationalist and anti-Polish views or belonged to the
Ukrainian National Democratic Union.355

                                                                   Patronage

       Article 21 of the Concordat, which was never put into effect,
provided that the matter of patronage rights would be regulated in a
separate agreement. The government regarded patronage as an
instrument of nationality policy. In practice, these rights were left as
they had been under the Partitions, except that the time within
which the patron must exercise his right was reduced to thirty
days.356
       In Galicia, patronage did give the ordinarily Polish patrons a
certain amount of influence over parish appointments, though the
mechanics of the procedure did not allow them any real control. In
1920 a conflict arose between 34 patrons of parishes in the
Peremyshi' eparchy and the Greek-Catholic episcopal consistory.
The patrons, represented by a lawyer, accused the consistory of

proposing lists of candidates for benefices who it knew would be
unacceptable to them, and of designating as unsuitable candidates
who in fact were above reproach and who "did not hate everything
that is Polish."357 The lawyer complained to the Council of Ministers,
the Ministry of Religious Cults and the provincial authorities that
the episcopal consistory was restricting patronage rights and
assigning benefices to priests who were decided enemies of po1sko6
and agitators schooled to struggle against Polish society. He added
that the consistory was preventing some priests from competing for
certain parishes, thus preventing the patrons from selecting priests
who had a peaceful, conciliatory attitude towards Polish society.
According to the lawyer, the Peremyshi' civic authorities asserted in
1921 that in assigning parishes, the episcopal consistory was
overlooking older, apolitical priests in favour of young candidates
imbued with hatred for polsko.358
       In some cases, the patron was the county government. 359 This
presumably rendered objection under article 19 of the Concordat
redundant.

                                                          Landed Property

      The Austrian laws on state supervision of church and parish
property, particularly the decree of 15 October 1858 and the law of 7
May 1874, remained in effect until the decree of the Council of
Ministers of 25 March 1933 declared them inconsistent with the
Concordat under article 25.360
      The Concordat provided for state purchase of church property
under the planned land reform, leaving specified amounts to various
ecclesiastical persons and institutions. For priests, for example, from
15 to 30 hectares of property would be exempt from government
purchase and subsequent parcellation. However, the agrarian
reform, which in any case was slow in coming, never affected
church lands, as church and state continued their quibbling year

after year.36 ' In Galicia, where Church and clergy had some of their
largest landholdings, 362 this might have been resented. However,
since parcellation tended to favour Polish settlers rather than the
local Ukrainians, the Greek-Catholic bishops -- with the exception of
Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv -- avoided parcellation of
church and parish lands. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi introduced
parcellation in the L'viv archeparchy in the 1920s, but was persuaded
to abandon it. The government had neither the funds nor the
commitment to force parcellation, and the Latin-rite bishops were
not interested in carrying it through voluntarily. In fact, Bishop
Khomyshyn was the only bishop in Poland to carry out a full
parcellation. However, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi found another way
of aiding the poverty-stricken priests. Relying on his power under the
Concordat to create and provide materially for new parishes, he
divided existing parishes where there was a maternal and a filial
church, leaving the new parish under the same administrator. The
parish priest could thus receive an additional salary.363
       The average size of benefice land of a Greek-Catholic parish
priest in the inter-war period was 52 hectares, compared to 33
hectares for a Latin-rite parish priest. In the L'viv metropolitan
province, the average Greek-Catholic benefice in 1927 measured 52
hectares, the average Latin-rite benefice 48 hectares. Typically, the
priest would rent out the land, though sometimes he would work it
himself.364
       One source of friction among priests was the disproportion
among their landholdings. In 1927 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi took the
radical decision of limiting the size of a priest's benefice to 80
hectares. At 2 zloty per hectare per month, such a holding would
bring 160 zloty per month - together with income from other
sources, enough to support a priest and his family. Priests holding
over 80 hectares were obligated to turn over 2 zloty per hectare to the
curial treasury every month. The sums thus collected were then
distributed to priests who had under 80 hectares.365

       Some friction seems to have occurred in the Peremyshi'
eparchy after the Concordat came into effect. Among the complaints
raised by some laymen against Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi in a brochure of
1929 was that before nominating a priest to a parish, he allegedly
demanded the income from a part of the parish property. The same
source alleged that in the Stanyslaviv eparchy, the income from an
apricot orchard belonging to a benefice was transferred to the
eparchial cathedral, and the income from a parish field that had
yielded oil was transferred to the episcopal ordinariat.366

                                                           Salary (Dotation)

       After 1918, the Polish state paid priests the salary that they had
been receiving under Austrian administration. Various new laws
were proposed. A joint clerical-state commission proposed that the
basic clerical salary should be equal to that of civil servants, with
supplements for the high inflation of the time and for seniority. A
government plan was introduced in 1923, pending the conclusion of
the Concordat. The Concordat of 1925 left clerical salaries at the
same level as under the Partitions.367
       From 1924, salaries were no longer paid by the state directly to
the priests. Instead, the state would pay the salaries ("dotations") for
the entire diocese to the bishop, who would then distribute them
among his clergy. This rule was retained under the Concordat. A
priest's income would depend on the size of his benefice lands.
However, the rules for clerical income spelled out in the Concordat
were never fully observed, causing some priests to complain. One
Greek-Catholic priest in the Stanyslaviv eparchy, for example,
received a salary despite the fact that he already had a 50-hectare
benefice; another, in the Peremyshi' eparchy, received a salary in
addition to the income from his 100 hectares of land.368
       On the whole, however, the Greek-Catholic clergy found itself
impoverished in the wake of wartime destruction and financial
crisis. Its condition was also due in part to its dependence on the
impoverished general population for sacramental fees.369

       In 1927, the Latin-rite clergy in the Lviv and Peremyshi'
dioceses received a somewhat higher total income than the Greek-
Catholic clergy of the corresponding eparchies. Although the Latin-
rite clergy of the L'viv metropolitan province received a lower total
income in that year than the Greek-Catholic clergy, the financial
needs of the latter, who in most cases were married, were
considerably greater. 37° Thus, although dividing the annual global
sums designated for the L'viv and Peremyshi' Latin-rite and Greek-
Catholic dioceses in 1933 by the number of clerical positions yields a
higher per capita salary for the Greek-Catholic priests,
considerations of family support (even in Peremyshi', where the
compulsory celibacy introduced in 1925 had only begun to have its
social effect) may modify or even reverse the implications of this
result.37'
        The average Catholic priest's monthly salary in Poland in
1935-1936, about 102 or 103 zloty, can be compared to the 130 to 260
zloty earned monthly by 85% of teachers. The latter, however, were
ordinarily entirely dependent on their salaries for their support.372
The average monthly salary for a Greek-Catholic priest in the L'viv
archeparchy in 1933 was about 105 zloty, in the Peremyshi' eparchy
about 111 zloty, based on the calculation referred to in the preceding
paragraph. To this would have to be added his income from land and
other sources, as noted below.
       In his negotiations with the Vatican representative
concerning the Concordat in January 1925, Professor Stanislaw
Grabski objected to the proposal that dotations should be paid in
global sums to the diocesan bishops, since certain "disloyal" bishops
might use their financial power to punish priests loyal to the Polish
state. It is clear from the discussion that Professor Grabski had in
mind the Ukrainian bishops, particularly Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi. 373 Certainly the government could control priests'
behaviour more effectively as long as it paid their salaries directly. In
1930, the Supreme Administrative Tribunal heard the case of Fr.

370     Wisocki 229-230, Table 44, p. 229.
371     This calculation is based on AAN, MWR i OP file 398. The yearly
salaries that it yields -- 1264 zloty for L'viv, 1332 zloty for Peremyshl' and 1293
for Stanyslaviv -- can be compared with the 1935-1936 average of 1233 zloty for all
Catholic clergy in Poland. Myslek 124.

Mykola Styslovs'kyi, who claimed back pay that had been withheld by
demand of the L'viv governor in 1924 from May of that year until 30
October 1925, when priests began to receive their salaries from their
bishops. Fr. Styslovs'kyi's salary had been docked apparently because
of his Ukrainian nationalistic activity.374
        Once the payment of salaries was entrusted to the bishops,
however, the government sought to use its financial power to
influence them to control their potentially "disloyal" clergy. Thus, in
1934 the Stanyslaviv governor Jagodzirf ski supported the Greek-
Catholic Bishop Ivan Liatyshevs'kyi's request for placement in the
fifth salary category noting that the bishop had considerable
influence among his clergy and was helpful to him in "realising his
plans" regarding them. The government also gave direct material
benefits to priests supporting the Sanacja regime. 375 Greek-Catholic
priests' retirement salaries were manipulated in the same way, and
discrimination between priests of the two rites was practised. At the
same time, Greek-Catholic church authorities were also accused of
financial discrimination on political grounds. 376 For its part, the
government kept files on political activities of both Latin-rite and
Greek-Catholic priests.377
       The bishops' control over salary naturally permitted abuses
unrelated to political considerations as well. In a 1926 letter to the
Pope complaining about their bishop's conduct, a group of forty
laymen of the Peremyshi' eparchy accused him of distributing
salaries arbitrarily, increasing or decreasing them depending on
whether he liked a given priest or whether that priest obeyed him.
They noted that under previous Austrian law, a priest was entitled to
an explanation of the amount of his salary and had a right of
appeal.378

Concordat, the government could agree with the bishops of Poland to
abolish the sacramental fees altogether, augmenting dotations by
way of compensation. No such agreement was ever reached. In 1928,
Greek-Catholic and Latin-rite priests charged the same rates in
L'viv county 1, but in Ternopil' county the Greek-Catholic clergy
charged higher fees and in Stanyslaviv county their fees were a
source of many conflicts with their faithful. A funeral could cost
anything from 10 zloty (L'viv county) to 400 (Stanyslaviv). There was
especially great variety in the amounts of the sacramental fees
charged in the Peremyshl' Greek-Catholic eparchy.379
      Sacramental fees involved priests of both rites in conflicts with
parishioners, especially with regard to funerals. Some Church
circles denounced abuses. In 1932, Fr. Jan Zieja published a
brochure addressed to his fellow priests on this question; he himself
did not charge sacramental fees at all.380

                                                     Miscellaneous Income

      Other sources of clerical income included state pay for
catechesis (350-1000 zloty annually), 38 ' fees for masses for special
intentions, 382 chancery fees (e.g. for issuing extracts from parish
records), 383 customary gifts from patrons (relatively rare after the
Austrian period), 384 oil leases, 385 and leases of parish land.386

       The average monthly net income of a Greek-Catholic parish
priest in Galicia around 1930 was 477 zloty in the L'viv archeparchy,
459 zloty in the Peremyshl' eparchy, and 591 zloty in the Stanyslaviv
eparchy. The corresponding figures for Latin-rite parish priests in

the L'viv and Peremyshi' dioceses (there was no Stanyslaviv diocese)
are considerably higher: 602 zloty and 608 zloty, respectively.387
        An assistant priest (vicar) was paid by the parish priest out of
the parish treasury. Generally, the assistant was entitled to
maintenance, housing, and a monthly salary, the amount of which
could be decided by the eparchial curia. The assistant could also
receive a part of the income from services, depending on his
participation. 388 It was the custom, at least in the Peremyshl'
eparchy, for the assistant to receive one-third of the dotation, in
money or goods, and of the income from the land (except for orchard
and garden). However, he also had to pay a third of the tax. The
parish priest and his assistant could sign an agreement on the
division of income and expenses, to be confirmed by the episcopal
consi story.389
        For purposes of comparison, Wislocki points out that the
average income of a Catholic parish priest was twice the average pay
of a civil servant who, unlike a Latin-rite priest (but like most Greek-
Catholic priests) had to support his family from this amount. The
contrast between a priest's income and that of his poorer peasant
parishioners, especially in the east and south of Poland, was
enormous. Wisocki also points out that although the state dotations
and contributions for masses were in standard amounts, other
elements of a priest's income varied considerably. Although the
dotation itself was low, the cost of living in village parishes was not
high.39°

                                              General Economic Condition

      However satisfacthry the salary of an average priest in Poland
might appear, the over-all economic condition of many members of
the Greek-Catholic clergy in Galicia was not enviable. In the
Stanyslaviv eparchy freshly ordained priests, who in the inter-war
period were usually peasants' sons, often found themselves in such
financial straits that they could not afford the journey to their first

parish. In many such cases, Bishop Khomyshyn would provide
financial aid. 39 ' In his Homiletical Lessons, which he sought to
publish in 1922, Fr. Teodor Savoika, parish priest in Selys'ky in the
Peremyshi' eparchy, complained that the Church and her servants
all too often were given donations grudgingly. He pointed out that the
hard household work which priests were forced to perform lowered
the intelligence, taking time away from necessary reading. Priestly
poverty, Fr. Savoika continued, could have important social
implications as well:
              And have our communities ever considered
           how, through their citizens' lack of benevolence,
           and the poverty of the priest, his prestige, his
           significance and power in the eyes of the world,
           of governments and people of another rite,
           another faith and another nationality must fall?
           Behold: when in some Ukrainian community a
           parish is funded for some persons of the Latin
           rite, they try to see to it that the Latin-rite priest
           should necessarily have more land -- at least a
           few morgv more -- than does ours. Why? Because
           everyone knows well that he who has more,
           holds his head higher. No one ever got rich with
           a skinny horse. And soon, very soon, a poor priest
           must fall into debt. He needs a pasture, and fire-
           wood, and straw, and something from the
           garden, and there's the mill, the road, and a fish
           at carolling-time, a hare for Christmas, and
           many other little things. And the stranger will
           very gladly give him all this, if only they see that
           his own people are refusing him. Payment will
           be taken care of somehow... And with the
           impoverishment of the priest there must follow
           the decline of religion, as we see in deepest
           Russia, and the decline of civilised life in the
           community. The decline of benign pride and
           loftiness of spirit in a priest is reflected in the
           community, and the community loses its dignity
           and integrity, and slowly becomes the slave of its
           enemies.392

      In October 1933 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi wrote to the Ministry
of Religious Cults and Public Education that for years, he had been
receiving smaller amounts from the Ministry for clerical salaries

 than what was indicated in the receipts. He referred to "the difficult
 situation" of his clergy, especially the parish priests, who for years
had been in heavy arrears for taxes as a result of "the catastrophic
 decline of the agricultural economy and the decrease in income of
the entire society and especially the peasantry."393
        The poverty of the clergy was acute in the mountainous Lemko
region of the Peremyshl' eparchy. In 1933 Fr. Vasyl' Seredovych,
 assistant priest at Lypovets', wrote to the Peremyshi' episcopal
consistory asking to be transferred. He had been at Lypovets' for one
year, "in extreme poverty." His daily diet consisted of potatoes and
bread. He described his life as no different from that of the poorest
peasant. He was in debt for his clothes and maintenance. The parish
yielded no sacramental fees. In addition, he had experienced
misunderstandings and conflict with the parish priest. 394 In the
same year Fr. Vasyl' Kondrats'kyi, parish priest in Turie Horishne
for the previous three years, asked to be transferred to the lowlands.
"The well-known hardship in the mountains, hunger, lack of
sufficient support, lack of pastoral work, and solitude, lead the
undersigned to declare that he no longer has the strength to stay in
Turie," he wrote to the episcopal consistory in Peremyshl'.395
        The problem was not limited to the Lemko region. In
December 1934, Fr. Omelian Kvit wrote in Nyva that Ukrainians in
Galicia were "all" poor, especially those with families, priests and
laity alike. For example, they could not afford to send their children
to secondary school or university. However, he remarked that some
priests complained too much and were too passive. He exhorted them
to subscribe to newspapers and read books lest they become
spiritually as well as materially impoverished, and ineffective in
their pastoral work.396
       In January 1935 Fr. Vasyl' Pryshliak wrote in Nyva that five
priests had joined the clerical Society of St. Andrew because they
needed the material aid that membership afforded. He complained
that the clergy of the province had not taken "decisive steps towards
securing their own and their families' material existence,
broadening and deepening pastoral work at the grass roots, or even

maintaining their positions in civic cultural-educational and
economic life."397
       In June 1939 a priest speaking at a meeting of the Komarno
deanery referred to the hard conditions of the day, particularly the
impoverishment of the peasantry. He stressed that priests must
share the effects of the economic crisis with the people.398

                                                Church Administration

       As in the Austrian period, the church administration required
deans to hold soborchyky or deanery meetings on a regular basis. In
1930 the official bulletin of the Peremyshl' eparchy reminded deans
that they were to send a report of each meeting to the episcopal
ordinariat, along with the minutes of the meeting and a copy of each
talk given, as required by the rules of the 1898 eparchial synod. It also
urged them to discuss primarily current topics and practical
problems. The ordinariat was to approve the programme of each
meeting in advance.399
        It appears that in the Peremyshl' eparchy at least, the church
authorities required detailed information on a priest applying for a
vacant benefice. The form submitted by the Zhovkva deanery office to
the episcopal ordinariat in February 1937 concerning Fr. Petro
Skavyns'kyi, the administrator at Smerekiv, who sought permanent
appointment to that benefice, included questions concerning the
priest's participation in deanery meetings, the frequency with which
he heard confession, his family life, his relations with the
parishioners and with other priests, his punctuality, and his
participation (if any) in civic and political life. The dean noted that
Fr. Skavyns'kyi enjoyed the favour of both the Ukrainians and the
Ruthenians in the village.400 Generally speaking, it appears that like
his predecessor Syl'vester Sembratovych (1885-1898), Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi gave preference in the assignment of parishes to priests
of a Ukrainian orientation.401

      As under Austria, a priest could only be removed from his
parish for good cause. In a number of cases, priests were asked by
the L'viv metropolitan curia to resign from their parishes. In two
such cases in 1931, the Ternopil' (Tarnopol) governor informed the
Ministry of Religious Cults that the curia was forcing the
resignation of priests who did not agree with its militantly
Ukrainian nationalist line. In a third case from that year, the priest
himself, a supporter of the Non-Party Bloc for Cooperation with the
Government (BBWR), blamed Ukrainian National-Democrats for
organising a campaign against him, and asked the Ministry to help
him retain his parish, which he had held since 1909.402
      In the Lemko Apostolic Administration, however, a priest
could be disciplined for virtually the opposite reasons. In February
1936 Fr. Ivan Kachmar was suspended "ab officio et beneficio" for
having incurred the hatred of his parishioners in Zlots'ke.
According to a May 1936 report by the vicar capitular in charge of the
Administration, Zlots'ke was one of the parishes where a priest of a
Ukrainian orientation, guided by political rather than religious
motives, had through his activity driven his Lemko faithful into the
arms of the Orthodox or Protestants.403

                                                  Secular Administration

       The Polish government's attitude towards the Greek-Catholic
Church has been characterised as polite but distrustful. The
detention of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi in Poznafi in 1923, motivated
by the authorities' reservations concerning his attitude towards the
new Polish state and its claim to Eastern Galicia, 404 set the tone for
their relations with his clergy.
       Political considerations were paramount in the government's
attitude towards the Greek-Catholic Church. However, no clear
policy was ever formulated to deal with the nationalities question. As
a recent legal commentator has said, "All the weaknesses of the
nationalities policy found their reflection in the government's

religious policy." Unable to resolve the major national and religious
problems with which it was faced, the government of inter-war
Poland limited itself to discussing secondary matters with small
groups of clergy inclined to compromise, which only resulted in
alienating other groups of clergy and laity.405
       This irresolute, ad hoc approach left room for abuses on the
local level, which alienated both clergy and laity. An anonymous
brochure first published in L'viv in 1925, but dealing primarily with
events in the Peremyshi' eparchy, described the situation in these
words:
               In the church area, good priests are refused
            [canonical] institution in their parishes without
            valid reasons; though without fault, they are
            removed from permanent positions; and they are
            harassed by all sorts of administrative
            directives. And recently, when the priests'
            society of St. Paul the Apostle brought a
            grievance before the League of Nations for the
            wrongs done to their brethren, it was
            dissolved.406

       This passage may refer, like much of the brochure, to alleged
abuses by the bishop as well as by the secular authorities. In fact, the
brochure hints broadly that the bishop was being manipulated by the
state authorities into pursuing action detrimental to the lower clergy
and the Ukrainian people in general.
       Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv, an enemy of
militant Ukrainian nationalism often accused of being too
conciliatory towards the Polish authorities, nevertheless complained
publicly of the latter's treatment of his priests. The local
administration harassed the Greek-Catholic clergy, he wrote on 10
September 1930, and treated them insultingly. Laying down a set of
guidelines for his clergy in dealing with the civil authorities, he
called on them to defend their rights and their dignity, without being

The quoted passage was censored from the 1925 brochure "Zakhody kolo
vvedennia tselibatu v nashim dukhovenstvi," published in L'viv, but was
introduced into the record of the Sejm on 15 May 1925 by the Ukrainian club of
deputies as interpellation No. 456 addressed to the Minister of Justice. As part of
the legislative record, this and other passages could then be published, which they
were when the brochure was re-issued as an appendix to the work cited at the
beginning of this note. This tactic was common in cases of press censorship.

disloyal, whenever the state organs abused their authority. If
necessary, priests should appeal to the highest authorities, and if
that failed, they should inform the episcopal ordinariat and make the
matter publicly known, even resisting the civil authorities if
necessary. Bishop Khomyshyn reminded his priests to behave
correctly in such situations and to maintain their dignity, never
losing their emotional equilibrium or allowing themselves to be
provoked. They must remain polite, but not obsequious. They should
not participate in events where they would only serve as decoration
or would be humiliated. In characteristically down-to-earth fashion
the Bishop, a peasant's son, observed that the Polish authorities "are
ready to regard and treat us as would a gentleman who pets a little
dog for standing up on its hind legs and turning tricks."407
        Police surveillance of the activities of Greek-Catholic priests
appears to have continued throughout the period. In May 1939 the
parish priest at Mistkovychi in the Peremyshl' eparchy was asked by
the local police official to explain the planned meeting of priests in
his village and to provide the names and places of residence of the
participants. As it turned out, the gathering was a regular meeting
of the Sambir deanery.408
        A regular point of contact between the government authorities
and the clergy was the collection of taxes. Under article 15 of the
Concordat, clergy were subject to taxes equally with laity. 409 In
practice, the Greek-Catholic clergy were subject to heavy and often
unjustified taxation. In particular, the road-tax and property tax
were often imposed in excessive amounts. Appeals were usually
futile.410
        As in the Austrian period, but to a greater extent, the main
point of friction between the Greek-Catholic parish clergy and the
government administration concerned the language in which parish
records were kept and in which extracts therefrom, as well as
relevant correspondence, were written. Of particular importance
was the form of surnames (e.g., Ukrainian "Szeptyc'kyj" or Polish
"Szeptycki"). The Polish authorities required that parish records be

 kept in Latin. They based their right to demand this on the fact that
 parish records were of a public, legal character. However, this
 demand was often ignored, even by the highest Greek-Catholic
 authorities. On two occasions, the metropolitan curia in L'viv
 recommended that parish records should be kept in the Ukrainian
language.411
        In 1926 Bishop losafat Kotsylovs'kyi of Peremyshi' appealed an
 order of Minister Stanislaw Grabski of 9 April 1926 regarding the use
 of Polish in correspondence with state authorities to the Supreme
Administrative Tribunal. The Minister claimed that the language
law of 31 July 1924 did not afford the Greek-Catholic authorities the
right to use a non-state language in correspondence with the higher
 state authorities. The Tribunal decided in 1928 that the matter was
not ripe for adjudication, since according to the Ministry of Religious
Cults, Grabski's order was in fact not a directive or decision but
merely an opinion, which had not bound or damaged the petitioner
because it had not been applied to him.412
        In his 1930 appeal to his priests, Bishop Khomyshyn of
Stanyslaviv noted that they often complained to him of the fines and
jail sentences imposed on them for carrying on correspondence and
keeping records in the Ukrainian language. He pointed out that a
priest was not merely a state functionary, since he was appointed to
his office by church rather than state authorities, did not take an
oath of office to the state, was not dedicated exclusively to state
service, did not receive sufficient pay to live from such service alone
and in fact was not really being paid to keep records but in
compensation for church property taken by the state. As a res mixta,
the parish record office was subject to requirements of both church
and state; nevertheless, the priest was not a state official and thus not
bound by the law of 31 July 1924 nor the executive order of 24
September 1924 to use Polish as the language of all official
correspondence. Bishop Khomyshyn further pointed out that on 11
December 1928 the Supreme Administrative Tribunal had
overturned the sentence of a L'viv priest who had written out an
extract from parish records in Ukrainian, on the ground that

 Minister Stanistaw Grabski's order of 9 April 1926 contradicted
 existing law and had never been legally promulgated. Nevertheless,
 since fines or arrests were continuing, Bishop Khomyshyn laid down
 the following norms: (1) parish records should be kept in Latin, (2)
 extracts for administrative and judicial authorities of the first and
 second instance should be provided in Ukrainian and for authorities
 of the third instance as well as military authorities in Polish, (3)
correspondence with authorities of the first and second instance
 should be in Ukrainian and with those of the third instance or the
military in Polish, (4) while the state administrative authorities may
inspect these records, they must not be allowed to take them away
without the agreement of the episcopal ordinariat, (5) the seal of the
parish office should be in Ukrainian and should be used on records,
and (6) letters addressed to the "civilian record office" should be
returned or sent to the episcopal ordinariat, because such an office
did not exist in any parish.413
       The L'viv metropolitan consistory, and particularly Bishop
Ivan Buchko, defended the parish priests before the civil
authorities. 414 As late as 1939, the Ministry of Internal Affairs
expressed its annoyance to the Ministry of Religious Cults that the
Peremyshi' Greek-Catholic episcopal consistory had gone so far as to
use the "Ruthenian" language in correspondence regarding a birth
certificate with the local civil authorities in a town in Pozna/i county.
It pointed out that the Polish language must be used in all
correspondence with civil authorities and offices beyond the L'viv,
Ternopil', Stanyslaviv, Volhynia (Wo1yr1) and Polissia (Polesie)
counties.415
       The language of correspondence or of parish records was
perhaps less of a burning issue than the form in which surnames
were entered in those records, since a name could be entered in
either a Polish or a Ukrainian form regardless of whether one used
the Latin, Polish or even Ukrainian language. Changing the form of
a surname was regarded as tantamount to changing the nationality
of its bearer. Whether such a change constituted the adoption of a

foreign nationality or merely a return to that of one's ancestors was
often a matter of dispute. It was natural for a priest baptising a
person in the Latin rite to spell his name in its Polish form, and for a
priest baptising a person in the Greek rite to render the name in a
Ukrainian form.
       In the Stanyslaviv eparchy, it was reported in 1938 that Fr.
Vasyl' Maksymyk of the Rohatyn district had Ukrainianised over 550
Polish surnames in the parish records. The matter was referred to
the procuracy. 416 In March of the following year, it was reported that
an official of the Rohatyn district administration had inspected the
records at eleven Greek-Catholic parish offices and had confirmed
that at every office Polish surnames had been Ukrainianised. This
matter was referred to the courts as a criminal case, and the offices
were directed to correct the improper entries in the records. Fr. Petro
Tkachivs'kyi, parish priest at Han'kivtsi in the Sniatyn district, had
presented to the community administration in Zadubrovtsi a birth
certificate in which the surname urakowski had been altered to the
Ukrainian form Zurakowskyj. The local police referred this matter to
the procurator at the regional court in Kolomyia for further action.417
       At a meeting of the clergy of the Stara Sil' deanery on 6 June
1939, the discussion of current affairs centered on the trials and
sentences imposed on priests in connection with parish records. In
that year, three priests of the deanery had been penalised by
suspended sentences of from six to eight months, and two others had
been released after trial. The members of the deanery asked the
episcopal ordinariat to defend them before the appropriate
authorities.418
       The legal context in which the Greek-Catholic clergy
functioned did not change drastically after the fall of Austria, if only
because the Polish regime did not succeed in replacing the
sophisticated Austrian ecclesiastical legislation with a
comprehensive and effective system. Church administration
remained fairly constant throughout the period under study, but
friction between the clergy and the secular authorities increased
under Polish rule. The economic situation saw the greatest change,

due to the ravages of the world war, the problems of the Polish
economy, and the recession of the 1930s.
       It is difficult to characterise the economic state of the Greek-
Catholic clergy. Although there seems to have been a real worsening
after World War One, the clergy's own accounts of its economic
status in relation to the rest of society cannot be expected to be
altogether impartial. The fact that the social complexion of this
group changed during the period under study, as discussed in the
next chapter, is a complicating factor. Yet the objective level of wealth
or poverty of the Greek-Catholic clergy is less important here than its
perception of that level. This perception was bound up with the
parish priests' attitudes on various religious, political and cultural
questions, which will be discussed in Chapters Six and Seven. As
will be seen in the final chapter, it was also an element of their view
of their social and historical mission.
        CHAPTER FOUR: THE CLERICAL ESTATE

       In addition to the legal and administrative strictures and the
economic pressures discussed in the previous chapter, the Greek-
Catholic parish priest lived and worked in the midst of a web of
human relationships. First, there was the inner circle of
relationships: with his family, which in some cases was part of a
virtual priestly dynasty; with his fellow priests, who formed a special
class within society; with his bishop, who ordained him and to whom
he was responsible; and to a limited extent, with the clergy of the
Latin rite. These relationships, and the changes which they
underwent during the period under study, will be discussed in this
chapter. Beyond the inner circle were the parish, and society in
general. The priest's relationships with this outer circle will be
discussed in Chapter Five.

1. Exclusivity

       Both Polish and Ukrainian sources have claimed that in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the Greek-Catholic
clergy in Galicia constituted something of a caste. In large priestly
families, Sons followed in their fathers' footsteps. 419 Fr. Isydor
Sokhots'kyi wrote in retrospect that this closed social class cultivated
Ukrainian traditions. 420 Writing in 1911, the Polish priest Fr. Jozef
Borodzicz contrasted the Latin-rite clergy, which like Meichizedek
was called to the priesthood, with the Greek-rite clergy, which like
Aaron simply inherited it.421 An anonymous author writing in the
"Gazeta Kocielna" in the following year characterised the Greek-
Catholic clergy as a "caste" -- closed in upon itself, conservative,
jealous of its material interests, bound up with the family, and
worldlly.422
       Upon completing seminary, a candidate who wished to marry
had to do so before ordination. It was customary for such a person to

immediately set about to find a wife, usually the daughter of a
priest. 423 Of a number of marriage certificates of candidate priests in
the archive of the Peremyshl' eparchy from 1900-1901, nearly all
indicate that the candidate, whether the son of a priest or a peasant,
married a priest's daughter. 424 In his memoirs, Fr. Tyt
Voinarovs'kyi recounts that having completed his studies in 1878 at
the age of 22, he had two years before he could be ordained, and thus
could travel about the province visiting families with eligible
daughters. He finally married a priest's daughter in 1880, was
ordained at the beginning of the following year, and about a month
later began his duties as assistant priest to his father-in-law. A little
over a year later, after his wife's untimely death, he became assistant
priest to his wife's grandfather at Kolodiivka near Stanyslaviv.425
        The custom of intermarriage among priestly families
naturally led to the formation of a caste. In the nineteenth century,
this had constituted the one coherent educated elite of Galician
Ruthenian society, though in the final decades a secular
intelligentsia consisting mostly of professionals (particularly
lawyers) began to assert itself. The clergy were generally regarded as
a higher class. Fr. 0. Prystai recounts that as a secondary school

school year at the seminary were very difficult in terms of maintaining student
discipline, because no one was occupied with his studies, no one prepared
properly for examinations or prepared his soul for the priesthood, but for
marriage.., nearly every seminarian had the addresses of all the married
priests who had daughters or of other persons who the seminarians knew had
eligible girls; it was towards this, and not towards their theological studies, that
their minds were turned." Mel'nychuk, Petro. Vladvka Hrvhorii Khomvshvn.

Olesnyts'kyi contain a vivid picture of clerical life in the Stryi area in
the 1890s, contrasting it with that of the clergy in Podillia (Podolie) to
the east:
              In the villages, the entire strength of the
           Ukrainian intelligentsia of the district lay in the
           clergy. There was much of it, but it did not
           present a very happy sight. True, here there was
           no aristocratic clericalism, as in Podillia. The
           local clergy generally consisted of good people
           who were hospitable and kind-hearted in their
           social relations -- and that was all. Social life was
           possible and pleasant here. Gatherings and
           receptions at priests' homes had a different
           character here than in Podillia. There,
           everything was puffed up and full of the
           consciousness of one's high dignity, sycophantic
           towards higher ranks and haughty towards
           lower ones. Here there were people who had not
           become overly accustomed to haughty thinking,
           rather being eager for merriment with a drink
           or at cards. The latter flourished especially in the
           mountains around Skolie, where famous
           specialists appeared, especially in the game of
           ferbel'. There were not many interested in
           serious debate, and still fewer in serious
           systematic work, although -- as it later turned
           out -- there were people here who given good
           leadership knew how to set to work and
           accomplish something good after all. Altogether
           it was harder to find serious thought or initiative
           among these people than blind obedience, which
           they never denied to whoever knew how to win
           their confidence.427

      Olesnyts'kyi goes on to describe the priest Fr. V. Davydiak, an
energetic and resourceful man, well-educated and well-read, who
like most priests in the area was a Russophile but who unlike most
Russophiles of the time was not an obscurantist, and did not shun
Ukrainian publications. He was also an excellent conversationalist,
distinguished by his pleasant manners, friendliness and wit, who
"knew how to enjoy himself." In fact he was adept at cards, won a
good deal of money, and was known in Skolie as the "king of ferbel'."

Olesnyts'kyi also describes Fr. Lev Shankovs'kyi, parish priest at
Duliby and dean at Stryi, who was sincere, generous, very hospitable
and very merry in company, and at whose house there were always
guests. Though a Russophile at heart, he kept his beliefs to himself
and lived well with both Ukrainians and Poles. Fr. Shankovs'kyi and
Fr. Volodymyr Martynkiv, dean at Skolie, made a jolly pair in society,
and both could joke, sing, and dance; indeed, "it seemed that they
could make a dead man happy." At the same time they were not fit
for public life, and no one expected that they should be.428
       The Greek-Catholic priestly "caste" was heavily Old
Ruthenian in cultural orientation, with occasional Russophile
tendencies bordering on the political, as will be discussed in Chapter
Six. What is relevant here is the fact that the demise of the Old
Ruthenians and Russophiles in the first decades of the twentieth
century coincided with the demise of the priestly caste. It would
appear that this group underwent social as well as ideological
extinction.
       A rough picture of the demise of the priestly caste can be
drawn by counting the number of family names that appear with a
given frequency in the "schematisms" or registers of priests and
parishes of the three Galician eparchies at different points in the
forty-year span between 1900 and 1939. Although one cannot assume
that several priests with the same surname, particularly a common
one, will be related, it is reasonable to suppose that a surname
appearing five or more times in the schematism of a given eparchy
in most cases will belong to a priestly family. Comparing the
schematisms for the Peremyshi' eparchy for 1896 and 1934, and those
for the L'viv archeparchy for 1897 and 1932-1933, one finds that (1) the
absolute number of surnames appearing five or more times in the
schematism decreased sharply in each case (from 22 to 8 in
Peremyshl', from 24 to 6 in L'viv), (2) the "disappearing" families
were not replaced, "new" families appearing with the same
frequency being very few (only four "new" family names appeared
five or more times in the 1934 Peremyshl' schematism, only three
"new" names in the 1932-1933 L'viv schematism). 429 In the 1936

schematism for the Lemko Apostolic Administration (created in
1934), despite the fact that the Lemko area was known for its large
priestly families, only one surname appears more than three
times 430
       An example of a priestly clan that gradually disappeared from
the clergy altogether is the Korosten's'kyi family, two members of
which already appear in the Peremyshi' schematism of 1828. In the
nineteenth century they intermarried with the I1'nyts'kyi and
Levyts'kyi families, both well represented in the Peremyshi'
eparchial clergy. The 1879 schematism lists five members of the
Korostens'kyi family, the 1896 schematism, four. All these were
married or widowed. Three appear in the 1902 schematism, but none
in 1928 or 1929. The last family members in the priesthood appear to
have been two brothers (both members of the Kachkovs'ky Society and
therefore presumably Old Ruthenians) who died in 1921 and 1926.
       What happened to the sons of such families? Many entered
other professions; some entered politics. Such prominent Galician
Ukrainian politicians as Oleksander Barvins'kyi (1847-1927), Evhen
Olesnyts'kyi (1860-1917), Kost' Levyts'kyi (1859-1941) and the Western
Ukrainian dictator Evhen Petrushevych (1863-1940) came from
clerical families. 432 The same is true of prominent individuals born
somewhat later, such as the composer Filiaret Kolessa (1871-1947),
the politician Dmytro Paliiv (1896-1944), and the nationalist leaders
Stepan Bandera (1909-1959) and Iaroslav Stets'ko (1912-1986). The

Petrushevych family included some ten priests in the nineteenth
century, not counting a few sons-in-law who were also priests. But it
appears that in the twentieth century most of their descendants
became lawyers or teachers. 434 Indeed, Fr. Sokhots'kyi claims that
most of the "professors" who constituted the first generation of
secular Galician Ukrainian intelligentsia and of the "lawyers" who
followed them and led Ukrainian politics in the twentieth century
were Sons of Greek-Catholic priests. 435 It has been estimated that
although in the inter-war period, the majority of the Ukrainian
intelligentsia was of peasant origin, during the first decade of this
period around twenty per cent were of priestly origin.436
       Mel'nychuk asserts that married priests generally had only
one or two children, and only rarely three or four; few of these
entered the clergy, and sons often became Radicals or
Communists. 437 In 1916, Nyva complained that many priests' Sons
had become enemies of the Church and especially of the clergy, and
blamed this on their fathers' failure to teach them that the Church
was closely tied to the people. The sons regarded their fathers'
priestly work as motivated simply by pecuniary gain, and concluded
that the clergy were the enemies of the common folk. 438 A Polish
writer concerned with Russian Orthodox influence in the Greek-
Catholic Church pointed out in 1912 that priestly families could be a
source of destructive ideas, noting that free love was first preached in
Galicia by a priest's daughter, and that a priest's son headed the
Radical movement.439

Kobryns'kyi, d. 1882). See Bohachevsky-Chomiak, Martha, "Natalia

       Whether or not Oedipal rebellion was an important
phenomenon in Galician clerical families, it is significant that sons
began to enter other professions. As will be seen in Chapter Five, the
Old Ruthenian convictions and the social conservatism of the clergy,
as well as their reputed aloofness from the common people, may well
have played a role in deterring priests' Sons from following in their
fathers' footsteps. Economic ruin and political discreditation of Old
Ruthenians and Russophiles during and after the World War were
probably more important factors. 440 In the meantime, the economic
hardship and employment discrimination suffered by the peasantry
and lower middle class in particular brought fresh blood into the
clergy.

2. Celibacy

       One phenomenon to which the fall of the priestly dynasties
cannot be attributed is the introduction of compulsory priestly
celibacy, discussed in Chapter Two. For compulsory celibacy to
diminish the number of priestly families would require at least 25
years, since the absence of priests' sons from the clergy could only be
assumed after the lapse of the number of years in which a candidate
would otherwise marry and have a child and in which his son would
complete his studies and be ordained. Thus, even the introduction of
partial celibacy in the L'viv seminary in 1918 could not have affected
the existence of priestly families in the L'viv archeparchy until 1943;
the introduction of compulsory celibacy in Stanyslaviv in 1920 could
not have registered its effects until 1945, and that in Peremyshl' in
1925 would only have made itself felt in 1950. Furthermore, the
priestly family as a horizontal unit -- that is, in the fraternal rather


general and seminary rector Fr. Oleksander Bachyns'kyi (1844-1933). The
younger Bachyns'kyi, author of Ukraina Irredenta (1896), moved to the
Ukrainian SSR in 1929 and was arrested there in 1934.
         Evhen Olesnyts'kyi says in his memoirs that the Shankovs'kyi family
"were reduced to beggars" by the war, when the villages of Duliby and
Hrabovets' were burnt to the ground in the military operations of 1914 and 1915.
The church, the rectory, all the parish buildings and the school at Duliby were
destroyed. Fr. Petro Shankovskyi, the only son of the Old Ruthenian Fr. Lev
Shankovs'kyi and his successor as dean of the Stryi deanery, had abandoned
Russophilism and become an active Ukrainian. He served both Duliby, where he
lived, and Hrabovets'. Because of a false denunciation, Fr. Petro Shankovs'kyi
was arrested by the Austrian military tribunal in Stryi and spent three weeks in
jail. Olesnyts'kyi, Evhen. SDohadv z moho zhyttia. L'viv, 1935, Part II, 20.
                            135

than the filial relationship -- naturally existed as long as the last
generation of priests' Sons survived.
       However, the imposition of compulsory priestly celibacy in two
eparchies and the encouragement of celibacy in the third did affect
the social complexion amd status of the Greek-Catholic parish clergy
in other ways. Most obviously, the number of married priests
declined. In 1879, 604 of the 770 secular priests of the Peremyshi'
eparchy were married and 131 widowed, with only 35 celibates.441
Twenty-three years later the picture had not changed substantially:
there were 654 married priests and 200 widowers out of 897 priests in
1902, with only 43 celibates. 442 In the Stanyslaviv eparchy in 1897,425
of the 534 parish priests were married and 101 were widowers, with
only eight celibate priests. 443 Between 1914 and 1938, however, the
picture changed dramatically in all three eparchies. In the L'viv
archdiocese, the number of celibate priests jumped from 38 to 154
(14.67% of the eparchial clergy in 1938); in Peremyshi', from 13 to 206
(25.3% of the eparchial clergy in 1938); in Stanyslaviv, from 61 to 245
(46.7%). Overall, the number of celibate priests in the Galician
province increased by a factor of nearly six (from 112 in 1914 to 605 in
1938), from 9.55% of the clergy to 25.25%. By 1938, married priests
numbered 1,541 or 64% of the clergy, and widowers 244 or 10.75%.
       What one cannot quantify is the change in the motivations of
men entering the priesthood in this period. In the Stanyslaviv and
Peremyshl' eparchies, a vocation to the priesthood meant a
commitment to celibacy. This was a radical break with the tradition
of the priestly caste -- and with the expectation of a comfortable
family life. It required a willingness to sacrifice the prospect of
continuing the kind of life one had grown up with, and to enter an
unfamiliar state of being which moreover would resemble that of the
traditional competitors, the Polish clergy. In any case, according to
Cyrille Korolevskij it was only a small minority of Greek-Catholic
priests that favoured celibacy, and only some of these wished it to be

compulsory; the overwhelming majority opposed When on 31
August 1918 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi announced in his official
bulletin that half the places in the L'viv seminary would be reserved
for those committed to celibacy, the first deputation to attempt to
persuade him to withdraw the order was composed of priests.446
       According to the lay protest to Rome against the imposition of
priestly celibacy in the Peremyshl' eparchy, the clergy passed
various resolutions against this action at their deanery meetings,
and in both the Peremyshl' and the Stanyslaviv eparchy celibates as
well as married and widowed priests appealed to Church authorities
against their bishops' actions in this regard.447
        The debate over compulsory priestly celibacy was at least
formally a matter of canon law, 448 and also figured in the
controversy between "Byzantinists" and "Westernisers" (see Chapter
Seven, Section 1). Here it is relevant to note the arguments of a socio-
economic nature, which loomed large in the public discussion. In
replying to the prominent lay representatives Oleksander
Barvins'kyi (a priest's son) and Iuliian Romanchuk (a son of a
priest's daughter), who after the failure of a larger delegation to
dissuade him from his decision on celibacy visited him on 16
September 1918, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi pointed out that under
current conditions, there were many positions in which a married
priest could not survive. For example, there were catechetical posts
not yielding sufficient income to support a family, some 200 parishes
so ravaged during the war that the rectory could not possibly house a
family, and many posts for an assistant priest who would not even
have his own kitchen and must live in a small room in the parish
priest's home, not to mention missionary positions for which a
married priest could not even apply. The metropolitan also rejected
the argument -- frequently advanced by the laity -- that priestly
celibacy would cut off the socio-biological sources of the lay

        Korolevskij 49-50. Korolevskij refers to Metropolitan Sheptytskyi's 1928
memorandum to Pope Pius XI, in which he explains some of the difficulties in
the introduction of celibacy among the Galician Ukrainians, such as the lack of
a tradition of celibate clergy and the antipathy for the one example of clerical
celibacy with which they were familiar: the Polish priest.

intelligentsia, pointing out that celibate priests would be better able to
provide education for peasant sons and daughters. Finally, he
asserted that the great majority of married priests actually favoured
the increase in numbers of celibates.449
        The imposition of compulsory celibacy in the Peremyshi'
eparchy in 1925 does seem to have caused a drop in ordinations --
from 44 in 1925 and 43 in the following year (third and fourth year
students presumably would have been reluctant to drop out at that
stage) to ten in 1927, six in 1928, 17 in 1929 and 18 in 1930. Although
the number of ordinations reached 34 in 1938, it did not regain the
level of 1925.° This made it all the more difficult to fill the many
vacancies in the Peremyshi' eparchy.45'
        Proponents and opponents of priestly celibacy disputed the
comparative zeal with which married and unmarried priests
carried on pastoral work. According to some accounts, married
priests were more dedicated to working with their parishioners than
celibates, who tended instead to continue their education.452
However, Bishop Khomyshyn argued that a celibate priest was more
inclined to make sacrifices, even of his life, than one with family
responsibilities. He was also readier to engage in social work: it was
celibate priests, and not married priests or laymen, who worked in
Catholic orphanages.453
        Married as opposed to celibate priests seem to have enjoyed the
approval of a good part of the laity. In the anonymous brochure of
1929 directed against Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi's imposition of celibacy
and other alleged abuses, the theory was put forth that compulsory
priestly celibacy was a Polish plan to undermine the Greek-Catholic
clergy, who "through family ties have become fused with the people
and have become its strength." 454 This in turn was part of a broader
plan of social and political domination:
            For while in earlier times, celibacy might have
          been only one of the auxiliary methods by which
          to destroy the enemy, today its has become

          social structure of the village has already
          changed, while here change is coming too,
          though by other ways. And some day the priest's
          household will share the fate of today's estate: it
          will be called upon to become a center of culture,
          an aid to social order, not only a religious-moral
          bastion but a patrician of national life. For
          without patricians no people can exist. If it lacks
          its own, it must have others'. But in doing this it
          will give those others dominance over itself.
             Our neighbours understand this well and, as
          a counterweight, they hurriedly build koci64ki
          and, per fas et nefas, they obtain land for the
          maintenance of pastors. They also understand
          that the home of our married clergy must be a
          powerful factor, and that it must be neutralised.
          And the surest way to convert the clergy to a
          plebeian psychology, to athmise it, to tear it away
          from its broad native horizons, to draw it away
          from the peasant or else to drown it in the
          peasants' mire, to ingratiate oneself "with cap
          and pap" and to make it the handle of the axe
          that is to undercut the very trunk of the people,
          the peasant mass, is -- aside from material
          subversion -- celibacy. Only boundless
          naivete fails to see this, while boundless
          venality fails to admit it.
             The "unseen hand" whispers to us that
          celibacy, as a high virtue, is an end in itself,
          which shall become an abundant source of
          grace. But in fact celibacy is not an end, but a
          means by which they can achieve their end.
          And the end? To deprive the Ukrainian peasant
          people of its spiritual and material basis, to bring
          about its total impoverishment and to conquer it
          once and for all.455

       The author of the brochure also claimed that, contrary to the
assertions of the Polish publication Czas ("an organ of the Cracow
Jesuits and Staiiczyks"), the Ukrainian peasantry was not
indifferent to the issue of priestly celibacy. Rather, it was "extremely
hostile to priestly celibacy," since it desired to see its pastors as
examples of family morality. The author, presumably a member of
the Ukrainian intelligentsia, associated celibacy with the stereotype
of Polish corruption and hypocrisy, by contrast with the equally
stereotypical morality of the Ukrainian peasant:

455   V oboroni pray 61.
                            139

             [Our people] is scandalised and looks with
           contempt on the "housekeepers" and "cousins"
           of Polish priests. Our people does not understand
           "two sets of books" in morality: one from the
           pulpit, another in practice, to which the Poles
           have become accustomed with regard to their
           priests. And it is precisely for this reason that
           our peasantry will most decisively oppose
           celibacy, as a blow against village morality and
           as a bridge to Latinism and to Poland.456

3. Solidarity

       Socio-economic changes in Galician society as well as the
imposition of compulsory celibacy undermined the priestly caste and
paved the way for the creation of a new type of clergy. In the
meantime, there was a danger that the priests' esprit de corps, their
sense of professional solidarity, might suffer. Andrei Sheptyts'kyi
recognised this danger even before he had assumed the Metropolitan
seat. In his first pastoral letter as Bishop of Stanyslaviv in 1899,
addressed to the clergy of the eparchy, he lamented the fact that the
clergy had lost its sense of solidarity along with its leadership of
society. The clergy was often divided among itself, due to the
development of political, scholarly and literary life. Sheptyts'kyi
ended his letter with a call for "MORE MUTUAL SOLIDARITY!"
and an appeal to his priests to be "of one spirit." 457 In his 1902
pastoral letter to the clergy on canonical visitations, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi again emphasised the importance of priestly solidarity,
and decried the party strife and other political and national conflicts
that divided the clergy.458
       On 13 February 1905 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, Bishop
Konstantyn Chekhovych of Peremyshl' and Bishop Hryhorii
Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv issued their first joint pastoral letter to

passages) had been made public by an interpellation in the Sejm addressed to the
Minister of Justice by the club of Ukrainian deputies on 15 May 1925.

their clergy, "On Solidarity." They flatly stated that in their province
"a clergy, as a solid body" did not exist. "Clergy" was but a concept: it
existed only in theory. Among the reasons for this were the lack of a
priestly spirit, as well as political party strife and language
differences which reflected the divisions among the laity. In
particular they criticised priests who published articles in the press
attacking Church authorities and institutions as well as one
another. Aside from matters of material or practical interest, the
Greek-Catholic priests could only form a majority in support of an
enterprise if it was wrapped in "patriotic clothing." The bishops
advised their clergy to concentrate more on spiritual matters such
as reading the Bible, praying, making confession and conducting
spiritual exercises. This would lead to greater solidarity.459
       One cause of friction among priests was their interference in
each other's parishes. Populist priests would sometimes found
reading rooms propagating their ideology in the parishes of the
conservative Russophiles, much to the latter's annoyance. This
caused so much conflict that on 27 July 1908, the L'viv Metropolitan
Ordinariat issued a regulation prohibiting parish priests from
interfering in the affairs of each other's parishes.46°
       "The Problem of the Unification of Forces of the Ruthenian
Clergy" was the theme of an address presented at the general
meeting of the Society of St. Paul the Apostle on 8 December 1910 in
L'viv by Fr. IosyfBotsian. Fr. Botsian stressed that unity amongst the
Ruthenian clergy was necessary in the face of multiple threats from
a hostile press, a religiously indifferent intelligentsia, schismatic
propaganda, and a "soul- snatching polonising attack on our rite and
our clergy." If the course of the past twenty years were to continue,
he declared, then in another twenty years there would be no more
need for the Greek-Catholic clergy. Idle, they would be entirely
discredited, as among the Czechs and the French. But it was not a
matter of defending the clergy's position, influence or interests as a
professional class, but of defending the faith of the people from the

twin threats of atheism and Orthodoxy. It was this that required
unity, that demanded "closed ranks facing two fronts."461
       Evidently, the Greek-Catholic parish clergy's engagement in
civic and economic work in the nineteenth century had led to a
certain secularisation of their outlook, to the detriment of spirituality
and priestly solidarity. 462 An anonymous priest looking back in 1937
to the early years of the century wrote that some priests preferred to
associate with atheists, Radicals and schismatics of their own
political party while regarding priests of another party as enemies.
Priests filled the periodicals of the time with "lampoons, calumny,
malicious gossip, baseless attacks against priests and even Bishops."
The priests' overzealous involvement in the reading-room movement
divided them further. It would even happen that while one priest was
celebrating Mass, his neighbour would come to the village and,
without his knowledge or approval, hold a meeting at the reading-
room.463
       Priestly solidarity was one of the topics to be discussed at the
extraordinary deanery meetings ordered by the Peremyshi' episcopal
ordinariat in early 1912. Dean Teodor Merena stated at the Korosno
deanery meeting on 3 February 1912 that despite the bishops' appeal
of 1905, not all the priests of his deanery communicated with each
other, and hatred remained. They were undermining each other's
authority in the eyes of the faithful.464
       In the period before World War One, much of the divisiveness
among the Greek-Catholic clergy stemmed from conflicts between
Old Ruthenians and Russophiles on the one hand, and populists on
the other. These movements will be discussed in Chapter Six. In the
1920s and 1930s, they were supplanted by other cultural and political
trends. However, the problem of clerical solidarity had not been
eliminated. In 1927 Fr. Ivan Shpytal' addressed a meeting of the
clergy of the Staryi Sambir deanery, saying that solidarity was

needed in the face of anti-Christian threats and of the declining
significance of the clerical state in society.465
       The lack of solidarity appears to have been one aspect of a
general problem of priestly morale. Various observers diagnosed this
condition differently and attributed it to different causes. In August
1905 Bishop Khomyshyn blamed poor seminary education for the
"mechanical and cold" character of pastoral work and the clergy's
lack of initiative. Lacking a strong apostolic spirit, the clergy could
not struggle against destructive currents and instead sought strange
harmonies between Christian principles and trends hostile to the
faith. Priests' families followed secular fashions, and "rarely can you
find a priestly family that would say their morning and evening
prayers together."466
       At Lent in the following year, an anonymous author (probably
a priest) blamed the centralism of earlier church administrations for
the passive character of the priesthood. The consistory at L'viv had
ceased to be a representative organ of the clergy, and was reduced to
a humble bureaucratic office. Accustomed to taking orders, the
priests were incapable of taking any initiative. The hierarchy, for
their part, were "crushed by our difficult times;" they did not even
dare to think about raising the prestige and authority of their
Church from second-rate status. Pastoral letters about solidarity had
been to no avail; what was needed was a spirit of independent action
which, arising from an awareness of the threat to the Greek-Catholic
Church and of that Church's lofty mission, would "electrify the
entire collective organism of our clergy." The clergy bore all the signs
of death, like Lazarus -- but like Lazarus, it would awaken to its
historic mission.467
       The laymen of the Peremyshi' eparchy who complained in
1926 to the Pope about their bishop blamed him for the
demoralisation of their clergy through discriminatory distribution of
beneflces, honours, offices and favours. 468 The anonymous, probably
lay author of the 1929 brochure cited above painted a strange and
melancholy picture of clerical life in the Stanyslaviv eparchy:

            In Stanyslaviv the clergy today is already
          divided, weakened, humiliated, totally converted
          into a "Church obedient." Only two priests, if
          they are friends, can converse sincerely, when
          they have the good fortune to meet. If a third is
          present it is already dangerous, for one cannot
          know whether he might not make a
          denunciation. More numerous meetings are
          permitted only in the presence of a "man of
          confidence." And as for these "men of
          confidence" -- who can enumerate them and
          who can grasp their task? The eparchial funds
          serve different persons and different aims. One
          can only read what the authorities permit.

      Writing in the January 1935 issue of Nyva, Fr. Vasyl'
Pryshliak observed that poverty aggravated the problem of morale:
"We see that together with economic decline comes moral
depression." He described the threats and pressures that
demoralised and sometimes divided the priests of the L'viv
archeparchy:
             Finally the morally negative factors, which
          are visibly growing stronger, strike us from all
          sides -- from our flock, from leftist elements,
          from sectarian religious subversion, and in
          addition from external factors.
                we regret to state that the present moment is
          the least propitious for our efforts. For not only
          has it nurtured material need, but it
          methodically strives to break the spirit of our
          clergy. Here and there it makes breakthroughs,
          destroying personalities, and we look in helpless
          dismay at the lack of discipline of certain
          individuals who compromise both the clerical
          state and their sacred mission.
             Contrary to the canons and professional
          discipline, our prestige is infringed, for
          aspirations and ambitions thrive. Not
          infrequently, the contacts of some of us go so far
          that they draw outside factors, hostile to us, into
          the whirlpool of their professional affairs -- and
          there rises to the surface an unpleasant
          embarrassment and the humiliation not only of
          an individual, but of the entire clerical state, in

           which they somehow found themselves by
           chance.47°
       In Nyva's April-May issue of that year, Fr. Pryshliak wrote
that his fellow priests were for the most part scattered and passive.
Even those who contributed to Nyva confined themselves to academic
questions instead of tackling live, contemporary issues.471
       In the Stanyslaviv eparchy, the jailing of priests for
"falsification" of parish records contributed to low morale. "The very
great and almost universal material poverty and moral depression
creates in some priests a kind of indifference to general church
matters, so that almost nothing interests them," reported Dobryi
Pastyr in its chronicle for the year 1939.472
       Efforts were made to remedy the problems of divisiveness and
demoralisation. There were priestly societies, charitable funds, and
publications. In their 1905 joint pastoral letter on priestly solidarity,
the Greek-Catholic bishops of Galicia complained that general
meetings of the Society of St. Peter or St. Paul drew only ten to twenty
priests, and rarely took any positive action. The widows' and
orphans' funds depended on the work of a few, and it took all the
pressure that could be exerted by the deaneries, consistories and
ordinariat to compel priests to make donations. When a clerical
newspaper appeared, they noted, out of nearly 3,000 priests one or two
hundred at most would subscribe, and hardly any would send
contributions. 473 In 1906 the pseudonymous author of the pamphlet
De ie ruskyi klyr? ("Where is the Ruthenian clergy?") reported that
the Society of St. Paul the Apostle, which ought to crystallise the
clergy's thinking about its ideal and its mission, had many members
but so few active ones that only 24 had attended the annual general
meeting that year.474
       Priestly apathy was not the only problem. The Society of St.
Paul the Apostle, which published the journal Nyva from 1904, was
dissolved by the government in 1925, evidently because it protested
government action to the League of Nations. In its place was founded
the Society of St. Andrew the Apostle. The Theological Scholarly

Society, founded in 1923, published the journal Bohosloviia and also
took over Nyva. In the Peremyshi' eparchy, a priests' mutual aid
society known as Peremys'ka Eparkhiial'na Pomich, founded in
1918, included nearly the entire clergy. There were accusations,
however, that Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi had founded this Society to
counter-act the Fund for Priests' Widows and Orphans. In
Stanyslaviv, the Society of Celibate Priests of St. Josaphat, which
published "Dobryi Pastyr" and initiated "Nova Zoria," comprised the
entire eparchial clergy. There was also a mutual aid society which
provided funds for funerals and aided widows of priests.475
Nevertheless, in 1935 Fr. Lev Hlynka expressed the opinion that
eparchial priestly societies were not enough; what was needed was a
single priests' organisation for the entire Galician province to defend
the material and moral interests of the clergy.476
       Among the editors of Nyva after World War One were Fr.
Iaroslav Levyts'kyi (see Chapter 2), Fr. Havryil Kostel'nyk (1920 to
October 1929), Fr. Petro Khomyn (November 1929 to January 1938),
and Fr. P. Kozits'kyi (February 1938 to the last issue in 1939). In the
1930s the journal was frequently censored, and the entire issue for
May, 1934 was confiscated, though some copies were distributed.477
As had been frankly stated in that year's January issue, every editor
of a Ukrainian publication was surrounded by prohibitions,
censorship and the danger of fines. Both ecclesiastical and
governmental pressures forced the editor of a religious journal in
particular to keep to the narrow limits of permissible content. 478 By
the late 1930s the journal had taken on a rather sedate character,
avoiding polemics and dedicating more attention to historical
subjects.
       In December 1937, Nyva criticised Bishop Khomyshyn's
instructions to his clergy not to participate in secular organisations.
One year later Bishop Khomyshyn announced in his official bulletin
that his clergy were henceforth forbidden to subscribe to Nyva

"directly or indirectly," or to read it. The resulting debate continued
into 1939.
       Bishop Khomyshyn did have his own publication for the clergy,
the weekly newspaper "Nova Zoria," published from 1926. For two
years it was edited by the seminary rector Fr. Tyt Halushchyns'kyi, a
Basilian. Then the well-known journalist Osyp Nazaruk, a former
free-thinker and anti-clericalist, took over and continued a spirited
attack on the Bishop's opponents, especially Nyva. "Nova Zoria" soon
had a print run of 5,000. Later it began to appear twice a week, and
claimed 10,000 subscribers. 480 Unlike Nyva, "Nova Zoria" was
directed at a broader audience, including the secular intelligentsia.

4. Priests and Bishops

       It was not only in the Greek-Catholic Church that conflicts
occasionally arose between the lower clergy and their bishops. In
societies where the episcopate was drawn from the aristocracy,
differences were inevitable. The fact that bishops were drawn from
the monastic clergy added a further dimension to these differences,
in both the Eastern and the Western Church. 481 In the Greek-
Catholic Church, the Basilian monastic order had become the sole
source of bishops, though after the L'viv provincial synod of 1891 non-
monastic priests (such as Bishop Khomyshyn) could be consecrated
as well.
       One way in which bishops differed from parish priests
was education (see Chapter One). Generally, future bishops were
sent abroad to study. Those who went to Innsbruck or Rome to be
educated by the Jesuits naturally came under western and
specifically Latin influences sometimes resented by the rank and file
clergy. When the students of the Ruthenian seminary in Rome were

1917-1982. Vol. I. Crestwood, New York, 1984, 44-45. With regard to the Russian
Church, Pospielovsky attributes this conflict to the "learned" or "academic"
monasticism required of those aspiring to episcopal careers, a worldly
phenomenon borrowed in the seventeenth century from the Roman Catholic
Church by the Kiev Academy and having nothing to do with genuine
monasticism. Andrei Sheptyts'kyi referred to the hostility of priests towards
monks, who were accused of ambition, in his first pastoral letter as Bishop of
Stanyslaviv, on 2 August 1899. "Nasha prohrama," in Tvorv Sluh y Bozhoho

transferred in 1904 from the tutelage of the Jesuits to that of the
Basilians, the objection remained, for the Basilians (particularly
after their reform by the Jesuits in 1882) were known for their
latinising tendencies.482
        The political role of the episcopate was another potential
source of friction with the lower clergy. The attempts of Metropolitan
Syl'vester Sembratovych (1885-1898) to find a political accommodation
with the Poles, which failed along with Barvins'kyi's "New Era,"
were opposed by the lower clergy, and created a gulf between priests
and bishop.483
        In the joint pastoral letter of 1905 to the clergy, the three
eparchial bishops criticised the improper understanding of priestly
solidarity which pitted the clergy against their bishop. Too often
priests would fail to inform their bishop of their fellows' errors (after
reproaches in private and at a deanery meeting had failed). Yet they
accused the bishops of failing to solidarise with them. "You wish us
bishops to be in solidarity with you, but you do not consider yourselves
obligated to help us in that which is the most difficult part of our
duties in correcting those who are falling or who have fallen," they
wrote. Furthermore, there were priests who criticised "every step of
the bishop" in the press. "When enemies publicly attack us, there are
those among you who are glad of this!" 484 A Polish observer wrote in
1912 that the Greek-Catholic clergy were divided from, and hostile to,
their bishops.485 In his 1910 address before the Society of St. Paul the
Apostle in L'viv, Fr. losyf Botsian (who less than four years later
would be consecrated Bishop of Lutsk in a Kiev hotel room by his
fellow prisoner Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi) denounced the habit of
criticising the civic and even the church activity of one's bishop,
which on the part of intemperate priests would sometimes culminate
in a declaration of no confidence in him. Confidence in the bishop
and unity with him, said Fr. Botsian, was "the first and necessary
condition" for the unification of the clergy.486
        Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi sought to bring the eparchial clergy
closer to the episcopate, visiting the priests of the L'viv archeparchy

every summer beginning in 1902 and continuing, with interruptions,
until his illness prevented further travel in 1932. In this time,
according to Korolevskij, he managed to visit each deanery.487
Episcopal visitations were not always appreciated by the parish
priests. It did occur that during a visitation the priest would prevent
persons with a grievance against him from seeing the bishop. In
their 1905 pastoral letter the bishops pointed out that the parish
clergy should regard them as friends, not enemies. "Truly, the
behaviour of many towards us is at times so insincere that it would
appear that distrust of authority has become a general rule."488
       The clergy had their own complaints against their bishops. As
suggested by the remarks of the pseudonymous pamphleteer of 1906
cited above, there was a feeling that the hierarchy was not doing
enough to protect the Church. Nor, in his opinion, did the bishops
protect their clergy from attacks by the laity and by the Polish
clergy.489
       Writing in 1934, Henryk Ignacy Lubieiski attributed the
conflict between the Greek-Catholic bishops and clergy to the
persistent influence of Byzantine Orthodox tradition. In discipline,
he stated, Greek-rite priests differed greatly from Latin-rite clerics.
Historically, Greek-Catholic priests had often demonstrated hostility
to their bishops, such as to Metropolitan Sembratovych; now Bishop
Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv was the victim. Most of the Greek-Catholic
clergy, even in his own eparchy, opposed his pronouncements. They
concurred, or at any rate silently acquiesced, in the campaign to
overturn his authority and to discredit him publicly. They brought
secular Ukrainian society into the fray, inspiring press campaigns
against their bishops. But the bishops themselves were not without
fault, noted Lubiettski; when the clergy of two eparchies signed a
petition protesting against a decision of the bishop of the third, their
bishops did not object.49°
       The clergy, as represented by the editors of Nyva, defended
their right to dissent publicly from their bishops' orders. Surely, they
wrote in 1939, they were not obligated to agree to everything "like a

dumb herd." After all, the bishop's ideas were not infallible. In
matters that did not directly concern dogma or the bishop's
authority, it was permissible to express a different opinion in the
press. As long as they did not violate the general discipline of the
Church, the priests could advocate an ideology different from that of
their bishop. As for Bishop Khomyshyn's order forbidding his clergy
to read Nyva -- the point of departure of this editorial -- it was
unheard of that one bishop should forbid his clergy to read a
publication that was published by permission of another.49'
        Despite the controversies over celibacy, participation in secular
organisations and Nyva, Bishop Khomyshyn appears to have had
close and cordial relations with his clergy. Fr. Roman Lobodych
(ordained in 1917), rector of the Stanyslaviv cathedral from 1930 to
1935, recalls that the bishop frequently visited his priests,
particularly those who were ill or in prison, and helped them
financially. Although he opposed a married clergy, he placed
married priests from the other two eparchies in wealthier parishes
near towns, so that they could support their families and send their
children to school. He also cared for deceased priests' widows and
orphans. As a result, writes Fr. Lobodych, the Stanyslaviv eparchial
clergy were especially respectftil and obedient.492
        While the attacks against Bishop Khomyshyn may indeed have
come primarily from the other eparchies, in the 1920s Bishop
Kotsylovs'kyi faced a virtual rebellion by his own eparchial clergy. He
was attacked by both priests and laymen for alleged misconduct in a
variety of matters: the introduction of compulsory celibacy,
administrative abuses (particularly his conflicts with the cathedral
chapter), eparchial finances, the events leading to his removal from
the patronage of the Institute for Girls in Peremyshi', and abuses
regarding an orphanage in that town. 493 The bishop was also
accused of tactless conduct towards the clergy, notably when at the
ceremony of the coronation of an icon of the Mother of God in Sambir
on 27 August 1928, he reportedly interrupted a sermon of Fr. Symeon
Kul'chyts'kyi, loudly commanding him to "climb down" from the
pulpit.494

       Clerical collusion in the lay attacks on Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi is
alleged in the 1927 reply to the bill of complaints of the Peremyshi'
secular intelligentsia (actually addressed to the Pro-Nuncio in
Warsaw) by Luigi Cardinal Sincero, Secretary of the Sacred
Congregation for the Eastern Church. In this reply, Cardinal
Sincero spoke of "some sort of ill-concealed understanding or
conspiracy between some priests and laymen, aimed at causing the
removal of their own Bishop-Ordinary from his see -- which is
clearly apparent from the complaint itself."495
       However, not the entire clergy of the Peremyshi' eparchy was
ranged against their bishop. At a secret meeting held in Peremyshi'
on 24 November 1926, 46 priests signed six resolutions in defence of
Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi. Among them were resolutions censuring the
"systemetic press attacks against bishops," and calling on the clergy
to defend them. They also decided to send a telegram of support to
Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi, and to support church publications such as
Bishop Khomyshyn's "Nova Zoria." It may be significant that the
apparent initiators of the meeting, and many if not most of the
signatories to the resolutions, were deans or other higher clergy.496

              It seems that there is no other state in human
            society that would have such a varied fate as the
            clerical state. On the one hand, high honour
            amongst the people, esteem even from strangers
           because of our clerical garb alone, but on the
           other hand disdain and hatred from elements
           hostile to the Church, and vexation from the
           Radical and socialist press. Just as honour for
           the priest for the lofty mission which he is
           fulfilling amongst the people, and for his high
           office, is completely natural, so hostility and
           hatred towards the clergy cannot at all be
           justified.497

       Thus wrote Fr. Iuliian Dzerovych in the clerical journal Nyva
in 1912. His words may recall the complaint of Iaroslav Levyts'kyi
about public perceptions of L'viv seminarians made in 1901, and
quoted in the first chapter. Unlike seminarians, however, ordained
parish priests lived their entire lives in the midst of civil society. They
encountered the laity on a daily basis and to an extent were
dependent on them for support. The Greek-Catholic parish clergy's
relations with their parishioners in town and country, both in the
pastoral setting and beyond it, are the subject of this chapter.

1. Pastoral Work

       In a province with as high a birth-rate as Galicia, one would
expect that adequate pastoral care would have required a growth in
the number of priests. The over-all number of Greek-Catholic priests
did in fact grow during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
century. 498 In inter-war Poland, the ratio of priests of all rites to
faithful improved, and between 1934 and 1937, the number of Catholic
diocesan priests of all rites grew by However, it appears that
the number of Greek-Catholic parish priests remained fairly
constant between 1900 and 1939. According to one source, there were
2,483 Greek-Catholic priests distributed over 1,875 parishes in "Little

Poland" in 1914.500 Fr. Tadeusz 1iwa states, however, that
"immediately before World War I" there were 2,478 Greek-Catholic
priests in the province, of whom 2,235 were parish priests. 50 ' A
government source indicated in 1935 that there were 2,198 Greek-
Catholic secular priests in Poland, with 1,854 parishes. 502 In 1938-
1939 there were 2,284 Greek-Catholic priests in Poland, with 2,491
parishes.503 liwa counts 2,232 Greek-Catholic parish priests in 1937-
1938.° Accepting his figures as true, it would appear that the
number of Greek-Catholic parish priests was remarkably static
throughout most of the period under study. 1iwa remarks, however,
that after the first world war the number of priests diminished, to be
replaced subsequently by younger priests of a different ideological
persuasion. 505 Thus, quantitative stability may disguise qualitative
change.
       Yet as mentioned in the previous chapter, the density of the
network of Greek-Catholic parishes and churches in relation to the
population was considered to be greater than that of the Latin rite,
giving the former an advantage in pastoral competition. According to
a 1929 report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in L'viv county the
Latin-rite population was somewhat larger than the Greek-rite
population (1,284,000 as against 1,141,000), but the number of Latin-
rite parishes was much smaller than that of Greek-rite parishes: 386
as compared with 697. Also, there were 39 Latin-rite churches and
chapels in the county as against 113 Greek-rite churches and
chapels.506 (It must be remembered, however, that the large Polish
population was heavily concentrated in the city of L'viv, where the
Latin-rite churches could be visited by Roman Catholics more easily

than if they had been in the less densely populated countryside.) In
1914 there were 1,854 Greek-Catholic parishes in Poland; in 1938,
1,970.°
       It would follow that in Galicia, Greek-Catholic parishes had
smaller populations than Latin-rite parishes, resulting in greater
availability of pastoral care. This is confirmed by comparing the
figures cited further in this paragraph with the average number of
faithful per Latin-rite parish in Galicia around 1910, which was
4,362. 508 However, the average Greek-Catholic parish population
grew in two of the three Galician eparchies. Before World War I, the
average number of faithful per Greek-Catholic parish was 1,773 in
the L'viv archeparchy, 1,749 in the Peremyshl' eparchy, and 2,343 in
the Stanyslaviv eparchy. Before World War II the corresponding
numbers were 1,067.62, 1,982.17, and 2,484.54. Yet Fr. liwa's
figures would yield an over-all average of about 1,983 Greek-Catholic
faithful per parish in 1914, and only about 1,927 in 1938. While these
figures indicate greater availability of pastoral care for the Greek-
Catholics, the concentration of the Polish population and of Latin-rite
churches in the towns and cities would have enhanced the apparent
availability of pastoral care for the Latin rite somewhat.
       More relevant to the question of pastoral care, however, is the
number of faithful per parish priest. On the basis of Fr. liwa's
figures, 51 ° in 1914 there were on the average about 1,645 Greek-
Catholic faithful per parish priest, rising to about 1,700 in the late
1930s (though an alternative figure cited by liwa would yield 1,495).
This would confirm the expectation that given a fairly constant
number of parish priests and a rising population, the ratio of priests
to faithful would have deteriorated somewhat.
       Some notion of parishioners' access to their priest is given by
figures on the number of parishes consisting of more than one
village. In the Peremyshl' Greek-Catholic eparchy in 1928, for
example, out of 688 parishes only 189 consisted of one village, while
499 included more than one village. In the Stanyslaviv eparchy in
1925, out of 417 parishes only 196 were limited to a single village,

while 221 comprised more than one village. 51 ' The distances that a
priest had to travel to reach his faithful were aggravated by the
mountainous terrain in parts of the Stanyslaviv and Peremyshi'
eparchies. The unavailability of a Greek-Catholic priest was an
invitation for transfers to the Latin rite or even conversions to
Orthodoxy.512
        At least as important as the availability of pastoral care was its
quality. In 1901, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi called on the clergy of the
metropolitan province to cultivate a spirit of sacrifice, going beyond
their obligations to engage in social and cultural work, so as to bridge
the social gap that separated the clergy from the people. Priests must
help the people educate themselves and improve their material life.
At the same time, they must double their efforts to teach the Gospel;
otherwise, he warned, the economic and educational movement
would turn against them and the Church. 513
        The Greek-Catholic bishops were evidently not satisfied with
the general level of pastoral care. In their joint pastoral letter of 1905
on priestly solidarity, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and his fellow
bishops indicated some of the typical failings of the parish clergy:
neglect of preaching and catechesis, malicious gossip, failure to see
to it that their families and servants attended liturgy on Sundays and
holidays, a lack of reverence at the altar, incomplete or careless
recitation of sacramental formulae, hasty confessions, hurried
celebration of the liturgy.514
        About six months later, Bishop Khomyshyn bluntly told his
clergy that they had been taken unawares by the various anti-
Christian currents of the day, mostly because of deficient preparation
in the seminary. Their pastoral work was inadequate: "In sermons --
banality and longwindedness, in confession of the faithful a
deficiency of spiritual guidance, in church singing a noisy
barbarism, in ritual a lack of taste and a chaotic disunity, and in
many churches a lack of aesthetics, dirt and neglect, which all
combine to repel the faithful rather than to attract them." He

reminded his priests that in order to be able to influence their flocks,
they must first educate themselves. They must learn to preach
plainly and effectively, stressing Catholic and not simply "Christian"
teaching. In particular, Bishop Khomyshyn prescribed steps for
sounder catechesis. 515 In a pastoral letter addressed to his eparchial
clergy six years later, in 1911, Bishop Khomyshyn mentioned their
pastoral work among the positive recent developments in what were
generally evil times for the Church.516
       A major problem in pastoral activity before World War One
was the threat of Orthodox conversions. Russophiles and proponents
of Orthodoxy had found compelling arguments for their cause in the
frequent conversions of Greek-Catholics to the Latin rite, mentioned
above. In 1912 Fr. E. Krynyts'kyi, parish priest at Bobiatyn, wrote to
the Peremyshi' episcopal ordinariat that priests should sign public
protests against the schism, and appeal to the public authorities to
defend the Greek-Catholic Church by banning "Russian spies and
agitators" and their periodicals and organisations. He also called for
priestly solidarity, and the splitting of some of the overly extensive
deaneries to ensure better control.517
       In addition to the effects of general devastation, pastoral work
was impeded in the wake of the world war because of the arrest and
deportation of a large number of Greek-Catholic priests, and the
flight of others (see Chapter Six). Some also died of typhus. This left
many of the remaining priests in charge of several parishes.518
       In the inter-war period, Catholic pastoral work throughout
Poland aimed at (1) deepening religious life, (2) forming a defensive
and an offensive attitude towards groups advocating a world view
hostile to Catholicism, (3) solving the social question, (4) raising the
level of culture and education, and (5) providing a civic-patriotic
education. A prime means of defending the Church's positions and
increasing its social influence was the "apostolate of the laity."

Catholic priests were heavily involved in helping to organise various
lay societies, such as the Apostolate of Prayer, Marian Sodalities, and
Catholic Action. 519 Much of this involved social and political issues,
so that it was difficult to distinguish pastoral from socio-political
activity. 520 A significant portion of the parish clergy in the
countryside, however, reacted with passive resistance to these
organisational novelties, which disrupted the traditional style of
pastoral work.52'
       The pastoral activity of the Greek-Catholic clergy was on the
whole similar to that of the Latin-rite priests. They followed Latin
models of spiritual life, and like their Polish fellow-priests
experienced a revival of pastoral work in the 1930s. Among the
organisations they helped form was the Brotherhood of the Most Holy
Sacrament in L'viv, and the Apostolate of Prayer; the latter existed in
over half the parishes of the Stanyslaviv eparchy. Church
brotherhoods and temperance societies were also common.522
       The Apostolate of Prayer, founded in southern France in 1844,
had reached Polish lands in 1871. It was strongest in the Austrian
partition, existing in almost every parish. In the 1930s the Apostolate
experienced a rapid development, counting some 750,000 members
throughout Poland in 1936. It was directed by the Jesuits. In each
diocese, the Apostolate was under the jurisdiction of the bishop-
ordinary, who appointed a diocesan director. On the parish level, it
was the parish priest who supervised its activity. The devotional
practices were simple, focusing on offering oneself to the Heart of
Jesus. However, the concept of dedicating one's entire life and
activity to Christ, combined with monthly intentions prescribed in
Rome, sometimes involved members in social and political issues;
thus, in March 1933 the Apostolate opposed communism and
plutocracy, in October 1936 it assailed Freemasonry, and in February
1938 it denounced Godless communism. The Apostolate of Prayer
has been described as a means for the clericalisation of social life,

and the clergy have been accused of using such devotional groups to
mobilise religious feelings for political aims.523
       The Greek-Catholic Church devoted much attention to the use
of lay organisations in pastoral work. 524 Brotherhoods, which
enjoyed a venerable tradition in the East Slavic lands, continued to
play a major part in parish life. Of the modern types of lay
organisations, Catholic Action aroused considerable interest in the
1930s, though it is difficult to determine how much practical work
was actually achieved. Created in 1905 by Pope Pius X and
encouraged by Pope Pius XI, the movement represented an attempt
by the Church to break out of its isolation in response to the moral
and spiritual ruin of Europe. In September 1930 Cardinal illond
introduced Catholic Action into Poland, and a conference of bishops
meeting in L'viv in January of the following year established a
statute for the organisation in Galicia. The Polish branch of Catholic
Action was re-organised in 1934, and by 1936 claimed 519,666
members throughout Poland, mostly in the countryside. The basic
principle of Catholic Action was the cooperation of the laity with the
Church in apostolic work. While avowedly apolitical, or rather
suprapolitical, the movement aimed to increase the influence of
Christian morality on political life. 525 In a joint pastoral letter to the
clergy and laity, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and three of the Galician
bishops recommended Catholic Action as a means to save the
faithful from moral and spiritual ruin. 526 The Greek-Catholic clergy
apparently regarded the movement as a way to increase the
Church's influence in a society dominated by political parties. While
the movement transcended social and political divisions within
Ukrainian society, the Greek-Catholic variant of Catholic Action
developed independently of the Polish movement. The anti-
communist and nationalist stance of the Greek-Catholic variant
attracted the secular Ukrainian intelligentsia to what was in
principle a form of the lay apostolate. However, in a letter of October

1931 to Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, Fr. Roman Berest wrote that there
was a lack of qualified laymen, which would force the clergy to do
most of the work. Unfortunately, the clergy itself lacked enthusiasm
and organisational ability.527
       In the Peremyshl' eparchy, an attempt was made to remedy
this problem. Articles were published about the Catholic Action
movement, 528 and a pastoral course on Catholic Action was held in
Peremyshl' on 4-7 September 1934. Each deanery was to send two
priests to this course, and over 115 attended. A variety of pastoral
topics was covered by nine speakers during the three-day course.529
       Greek-Catholic priests in Galicia recognised that they had to
go beyond the church and the rectory in order to have sufficient
contact with the faithful. For example, in 1928 Fr. losyf Marynovych
suggested at a meeting of Peremyshl' Eparchial Aid (a priests'
society) that other points of contact such as the school, the reading-
room, and the village cooperative should be utilised. 53 ° The meeting
decided that new pastoral methods should be discussed at deanery
meetings, that model sermons should be printed in the eparchial
bulletin and homiletic handbooks disseminated, and that the
Apostolate of Prayer should be propagated. Priests should also work
in reading-rooms and cooperatives and try to draw the intelligentsia
into activity beneficial to Church and people. 53 ' Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi,
who attended this meeting, favoured the introduction of modern
pastoral methods, and established Catholic Action in his eparchy in
1931. He also stressed the importance of the press, dedicating three or
four pastoral letters to this topic.532
       In the mid-1930s the Greek-Catholic bishops called on their
clergy as well as the faithful to prepare for a struggle against the

"enemies of God" who were infiltrating social organisations and
threatening the faith. They recommended that priests and laity work
together in Catholic Action to avert the danger. 533 Yet in 1935 Fr.
Vasyl' Pryshliak, while recognising that the new "religious
offensive" would require "a new attitude of spirit, new tactics, new
armament and training" -- and a new pastoral and theological
approach -- lamented the fact that in their pastoral work, most of the
Greek-Catholic clergy had not gone beyond academic manuals and
were not interested in developing their activity in a contemporary
spirit. Catholic Action was not widely understood, and the clergy
remained in a state of incomprehensible calm, indifference, or
complacency. 534 Similar sentiments were expressed anonymously in
Nyva by a 70-year-old priest in 1934. Many priests had become
indifferent, apathetic. Their formalistic style of work resembled that
of bureaucrats, and they were not accessible to their faithful. More
active priests, on the other hand, often proved ineffective because in
the seminary they had not been prepared for practical work. This
was particularly true in Peremyshi' and Stanyslaviv. The new
German pastoral methods meant nothing to them. Meanwhile, in
the West priests were being re-educated through special pastoral
courses. Furthermore, the Greek-Catholic clergy were also falling
behind their Polish neighbours in this respect. He suggested that
rather than waiting for their superiors to remedy the situation, the
priests themselves should draw up a plan for their continuing
pastoral education. "Let us not allow the enemy to prevail with
modern weapons!"535
       The need for modern pastoral methods was felt by Fr. Stefan
Hrynevets'kyi, speaking at the Iaroslav (Jaroslaw) deanery meeting
on 23 May 1939 on "The Obligations of the Pastor at the Present
Time." The priest must set an example by living a holy life, but he
must also develop his knowledge, both theological and secular. As in
the past, the Church must prove that all human knowledge can
serve to explain and defend the Catholic faith. The most important
condition of effective pastoral work, however, was familiarity with

the parish itself -- with the people, their character, their world view.
In addition to maintaining contact with parishioners through social
orgnisations, Fr. Hrynevets'kyi recommended maintaining a file of
parish statistics. This would also help him in conducting pastoral
work in the home, a technique proved effective in the West. 536 Fr. D.
Kuzmins'kyi, speaking at the Sambir deanery meeting in May of the
same year, suggested that in addition to prayer, example, and work
in religious societies, priests should obtain motion picture projectors
and tour the villages with Christian films on moral and religious
topics .537
        Faced with a moral decline which they attributed to the world
war, and with social, ideological and sectarian threats to the faith,
Greek-Catholic priests of the 1930s continued to seek more effective
pastoral methods. 538 A common means to foster their flocks'
spiritual development was to organise missions by visiting monastic
preachers, typically Basilians or Redemptorists. To further the
religious education of their faithful, priests founded parish libraries,
which contained a mix of religious and secular literature. 539 A
special opportunity to raise the moral and spiritual level of the
faithful, which had strong political overtones as well, was the 950th
anniversary of the Baptism of Rus' in 1938.°
        A separate aspect of pastoral work was familiarising the
faithful with the social doctrine of the Catholic Church. This was
especially important in Galicia, where rural poverty and, in the
1930s, urban unemployment brought about a political radicalisation
of society. In 1931, on the fortieth anniversary of the encyclical
"Rerum novarum" (and before the appearance of the encyclical letter
"Quadragesimo anno" on 15 May of that year), the Bishop of

Peremyshi' issued a letter which was to be read out by every parish
priest on one of the Sundays in May in place of a sermon.541 At a
meeting of the Stara Si!' deanery in June of 1939, the assembled
parish priests resolved to explain to their faithful the Papal
encyclicals on the social question.542
       The requirement that priests concern themselves with matters
which, like the social question, lay outside the confines of traditional
pastoral duties, compelled them to "come out of the sacristy" and into
society. There they faced a bewildering variety of social, cultural and
political issues. Some of these issues will be discussed in Chapters
Six through Eight. First, however, it is necessary to survey the
clergy's social relationships beyond the sacristy.

2. Relations with the Secular Intelligentsia

       By 1900, the secularisation of Ruthenian Galician society was
well under way. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi seems to have accepted
this process as natural, but felt that the Church had to retain its
position of leadership in the moral and spiritual domain. In concrete
terms this meant that some kind of accommodation would have to be
found between the clergy and the secular intelligentsia. This was not
a simple matter, however, as a significant portion of the
intelligentsia was anti-clerical. Many had come under the influence
of western European socialist ideas as transmitted by their
countrymen from Russian Ukraine such as Mykhailo Drahomanov
and Mykhailo Hrushevs'kyi, and interpreted by local intellectuals
like Ivan Franko and Mykhailo Pavlyk. Anti-clericalism led in some
cases to outright atheism. On the other hand, the persistence of
Russophile notions among the Greek-Catholic clergy alienated many
Populists who otherwise might be sympathetic to religion and the
Catholic Church. 543 Later, when the clergy generally abandoned

Rerum Novarum, see Kirwan, Joseph, trans. Rerum Novarum. London, 1983.
Some of the ideas of "Rerum Novarum" had already been transmitted through
the pastoral letters of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi which, however, were concerned
specifically with the problems of Galicia. See Krawchuk, Andrii. "Sheptytskyi
and the Ethics of Christian Social Action," in Magocsi, Paul R., ed. Morality
and Reality: the Life and Times of Andrei SheDtvts'kvi. Edmonton, Alberta,

Russophilism and gradually joined first the populist, then the
Ukrainian national movement, they were able to form a rough
coalition with the bulk of the secular intelligentsia, who for the most
part had tempered their social radicalism. Only the radical left-wing
intelligentsia on the one hand, and the radical right-wing
nationalists on the other, remained at odds with the clergy. (These
issues will be discussed in detail in Chapters Six and Seven.)
       In his first pastoral letter upon assuming the episcopal see of
Stanyslaviv in 1899, Andrei Sheptyts'kyi addressed the problem of the
clergy's relations with the secular intelligentsia. Admitting that the
former were losing ground to the latter with regard to social
influence, he declared that the clergy would not try to regain the lost
ground: "The times when the priests alone represented the
Ukrainian intelligentsia are past, never to ieturn!" In matters of
faith and morals, however, they must retain their leadership of
society. Thus, the clergy were obligated to oppose the Radicals'
doctrine of atheism and the socialists' rejection of the Christian
concepts of family and property. For more and more of the
intelligentsia were becoming non-believers, or regarded Christianity
with rationalistic indifferentism, which essentially was paganism.
To convert them, wrote Bishop Sheptyts'kyi, priests must pray, but
they must also come to understand the intelligentsia and their ideas.
In conversations as well as sermons, they must set out Christian
dogmas with precision.544
       One of Sheptyts'kyi's first pastoral letters upon assuming the
Metropolitanate of Halych in 1901 was directed to the Ruthenian
intelligentsia. Rejecting the notion that Christianity was a purely
private matter, he asserted that it was a norm of social life that could
play a unifying role in a society threatened by the loss of ethical
principles and divided in terms of social ideals.545

        In his August, 1905 pastoral letter to his clergy, Bishop
Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv asserted that on the whole, the secular
intelligentsia remained in the Church, but had allowed itself to be
terrorised by a few Godless individuals. Most of the intelligentsia
were passive, he wrote, and not even a small group could be found
who would dedicate themselves to Christian work. Meanwhile, the
press and belles-lettres continued to assail Christian morality, the
faith, and the Church.546
        The friendly social relations between the largely Old
Ruthenian or Russophile clerical caste and the secular intelligentsia
in one district of Galicia were mentioned in the previous chapter.
These of course were not universal, particularly with the growth and
increasing militancy of the populist and radical socialist movements.
An example of the sort of conflict that could arise was that which
occurred in the Lemko region in 1902 between Fr. Teofil'
Kachmarchyk, Fr. Ivanyshov and other lay and clerical Russophiles
on the one hand, and Vasyl' Iavors'kyi and Petro Linyns'kyi on the
other. The latter were government officials and deputies as well as
lay activists with a Ukrainian populist orientation, who had
organised a Ruthenian students' home in Nowy Scz for the poor,
ignorant Lemko population. Their efforts were attacked by the
Russophile priests, who reportedly called them atheists. "From
ancient times," wrote Iavors'kyi, "our Clergy has not shut itself off
from secular people with a Chinese wall, as in the West, where
'schweigt der Laie'; on the contrary, our clergy sought to join the
laity to them..." Fr. Kachmarchyk, however, had "dug a chasm
between the clerical and lay people." The lay activists wished th work
with the people, and they sought cooperation, not obstruction, from
the clergy.547
        To some Polish critics of the Greek-Catholic Church, conflicts
between the emerging Ukrainian secular intelligentsia and their
clergy proved the latter's ineffectiveness. Spiritually weakened by the
Josephinist tradition, Greek-Catholic priests had little influence on

 the people and none on the intelligentsia, wrote an anonymous
 author in 1912. He quoted a Fr. Szczepkowicz, who had stated that the
 Ruthenian intelligentsia, which opposed the clergy and Christianity
 itself, were pushing the priests out of the educational and economic
 institutions which the clergy had helped to found. In 1908 "Prosvita"
 (the enlightenment society founded in 1868 by Greek-Catholic priest
 Fr. Stepan Kachala) had published a brochure advocating free-
 thinking and secular schools, and the daily newspaper "Dilo" had
 demanded emancipation of school youth from religious
influences.548
         In 1916, "Fr. S.M. from B." confronted the problem squarely, if
pseudonymously, in the pages of Nyva. The clergy were complaining
that the intelligentsia had become alienated from the Church,
indifferent, even hostile. However, it was the priests themselves who
were at fault, for they had failed to educate and inspire the
intelligentsia, to draw them closer to the Church. "The best proof of
this is all those members of the intelligentsia who, having married
Polish women, so readily abandon what is theirs.... Sometimes when
they enter a [Greek-Catholic] church they at times act as if they were
in a Chinese or Indian pagoda." It was not that they were atheists or
Freemasons; many, indeed, were more or less religious, and some
would defend the Church on behalf of the people. The problem was
that they did not understand the close ties between Church and
people.549
        The alarm expressed by some of the Greek-Catholic parish
priests and bishops about the anti-clerical attitudes of the
intelligentsia were not greatly exaggerated. In 1921 Anton Korczok
characterised the Ukrainian Galician intelligentsia as often
indifferent to religion, opposed to the Union, and even atheistic.
Priests' sons had converted to Orthodoxy or joined the Freemasons.
The Ukrainian press was anti-religious.550
        In the Peremyshl' eparchy in the 1920s some members of the
intelligentsia blamed Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi and his chosen clergy for

the ongoing conflicts. Unlike the earlier strife in the Lemko region,
this was not a battle between Russophiles and populists, but
apparently a power struggle between the higher clergy and a group
of intelligentsia joined by dissatisfied priests. One of the disputes
involved the ancient brotherhood of St. Nicholas at the Peremyshl'
Greek-Catholic Cathedral, which cared for pupils and students.
Among the priestly and lay members was nearly the entire
Ukrainian intelligentsia of the town. Fr. Konstantyn Bohachevs'kyi,
one of Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi's appointees (and a future bishop and
metropolitan in the United States) allegedly removed the more
prominent members of the intelligentsia from the brotherhood,
leading it "nearly to its downfall."55'
       The clergy also encountered the lay intelligentsia in various
secular organisations. As mentioned in Chapter One, the L'viv
seminary prepared candidate priests for parish life through extra-
curricular activities such as the reading-room and similar clubs,
and in 1926 the "Prosvita" Society in L'viv invited seminarians to give
talks at various reading-rooms throughout the city. 552 Although
"Prosvita" was intended for the education of the peasant masses, it
was directed by the clerical and lay intelligentsia, and became a
battleground of their conflicting interests. The conflict became acute
in the first years after the world war, when a number of branches of
"Prosvita" came under the domination of extreme left-wing
elements. The purging of these elements from the organisation in
the mid-1920s made clerical cooperation again possible. However, the
influence of nationalist elements in the 1930s caused new tensions
between the lay and clerical "Prosvita" activists.
       In the meantime, a debate arose amongst the clergy regarding
participation in secular organisations. Some favoured more active
participation, arguing that this could increase the Church's
influence and avert a take-over by Radical, Communist or other
hostile elements. Others felt that by taking part in organisations
already controlled by anti-Catholic elements, priests would be
publicly lending their support and approval to hostile movements. In

 1927 a contributor to "Nova Zoria" identifying himself only as "a
young priest" wrote that the clergy must frequently visit social
organisations and play a leading role in them, lest they be lost to the
anti-Christian camp. Priests must "pour a Christian spirit" into
Ukrainian institutions; otherwise, there would be sects in every
village, the churches would be empty, and the faithful would turn to
Communism. Indeed, the clergy must "take active part in all
manifestations of civic life -- even if we are not invited." They must be
active in the reading-rooms; this was a matter of their very survival.
In particular, "Prosvita" must be saved from the enemy. 553 In the
Peremyshi' eparchy Fr. losyf Il'nyts'kyi said at the Turka deanery
meeting in May of 1927 that priests should be in the community
councils, and the dean urged his priests to draw the intelligentsia
closer to the clergy, since the intelligentsia were in a position to
influence the spirit of the people. 554 At the Rudky deanery meeting in
that same month, however, opinions were divided: Fr. Onyshkevych
felt that the priests should be active in Ukrainian institutions, but Fr.
Kondrats'kyi advised that they should decisively break all ties with
the Ukrainian intelligentsia, since it was hostile to clergy and
Church. Having been driven by the intelligentsia out of the very
institutions they had created, the priests should instead form
exclusively priestly institutions.555
       In the Stanyslaviv eparchy, the debate ended when, as
mentioned above, Bishop Khomyshyn decided that his clergy must
found their own organisations and avoid participation in secular
institutions. He proceeded to set up his own press and reading-room
society under the name "Skala" -- "the Rock." In 1937 a priest of the
Stanyslaviv eparchy anonymously wrote a book, published by "Skala,"
in which he sought to demonstrate the error of priests who had
participated heavily in lay organisations. He cited the example of a
priest who had served the same parish for 35 years. His first task had
been to found the parish reading-room. "The priest must come out of
the sacristy," this priest used to say, "and go out among the people
into the reading-room..." Yet after 30 years of tireless work he was
excluded from the organisation. The author concluded that a priest

must influence the reading-room not as a mere member or even a
director, but as a priest, speaking from the pulpit or in the
confessional with the benefit of his clerical authority. He must also
pray for the reading-room and its members.556
       The author, who evidently had been active since the early
 1900s, criticised priests who used to associate with "various kinds of
gentlemen from town, often Radicals, atheists and schismatics, open
enemies of the Bishop, the Church and the clergy," simply because
they were reading-room activists and patriots, and prided themselves
on being called "active" priests who "were with the people." Such
priests had misled the faithful by tacitly approving of the activities of
the enemies of the Church. At a deanery meeting in the early 1900s,
he recounted, a priest had advocated founding a reading-room in
every parish. When one of his colleagues objected that the local
Prosvita activists were Radicals, he had confidently replied that "the
Devil isn't as terrible as he is made out to be," and that they would
take care of the Radical threat. He then proudly exhibited his
reading-room, which contained various anti-clerical publications
and portraits of writers like the anti-clerical Ivan Franko. Asked
why there were no missionary tracts or holy pictures in the room, he
replied that such questions were redolent of clericalism, which he
regarded as even more harmful than Radicalism. The majority of
the priests present agreed. On another occasion around 1910, four
priests took part in a civic rally held on the Sunday of the Sacred
Heart, while 200 paces away a solemn service and procession were
taking place. 557 The anonymous author from the Stanyslaviv eparchy
felt that in their zeal to cooperate with the secular intelligentsia, the
clergy had simply been deceived:
             Our secular intellectuals, popular activists in
          our cities and towns, the so-called 'gentlemen
          from town,' from our various branch
          institutions, cleverly concealed their leftist
          convictions for a while and calmly collaborated
          with the clerical activists until, as they say, they
          'got their feathers,' that is, until with the help of
          the priests they gained the confidence of the
          blind masses and a strong position in the
          institutions. Now, thanks chiefly to the activist
          priests, who used to support them before the

          people at all times and places, they have attained
          significant influence and have ceased to hide
          their leftist views and in their impetus they are
          going too far. It is becoming all too obvious that
          many of them are abusing their positions in
          popular institutions for ruinous and openly
          atheist agitation, to the harm of Church and
          people.558

       Meanwhile the priests who had founded the reading-rooms
and other popular institutions and had brought the intelligentsia
into them were being forced out by that same intelligentsia. The
"Prosvita" reading-room was "no longer a field of work, but a field of
battle." Yet it was prudence, not cowardice, to retreat from this
pointless battle and retrench in a stronger, defensible position. Such
a position was Bishop Khomyshyn's reading-room network "Skala."
But first, priests must break with the lay intelligentsia, withdraw
from the secular reading-room organisations, and avoid the
company of the enemies of the Church.559
       Whether or not the attitudes of the intelligentsia in the L'viv
and Peremyshi' eparchies resembled what Bishop Khomyshyn and
his clergy perceived them to be in Stanyslaviv, clerical attitudes there
were altogether different. As was mentioned in the previous chapter,
in 1938 Bishop Khomyshyn forbade his clergy to read Nyva
(published in L'viv with the approval of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi)
because in the previous year it had disagreed with his prohibition of
clerical participation in secular organisations and public events.560
Nyva expressed what was probably the opinion of most parish
priests in the L'viv and Peremyshi' eparchies, if not in the
Stanyslaviv eparchy, on this point. As will be seen below, priests
continued to be active in organised social life. Several priests
ordained in the Peremyshi' eparchy in the 1930s responded in
interviews or questionnaires either that they had entertained good
relations with the secular intelligentsia or that there was no
Ukrainian intelligentsia in their parishes at all; one, however, had
experienced difficulties with a lay Russophile.561

 3. Relations with the Countryside
        "Peasantry" is a misleading term for the majority of a village
 priest's parishioners. They varied from well-off farmers of serf
 ancestry who lived better than many members of the petty gentry, to
landless day-labourers. Some were in the process of entering the
town or village intelligentsia -- typically through the reading-room
founded by the local priest. Thus, they were not a clear-cut or mono-
lithic group. However, because the sources refer to them separately
(sometimes as "peasants" or "villagers," sometimes as "the people"),
and because their occupation with agriculture or crafts did distin-
guish them from the professionals of the intelligentsia, they will be
dealt with here -- with some reservations -- as if they constituted a
"peasant class."
        "Peasant" attitudes towards the clergy remain an object of
mystery, and the myth of the inscrutable peasant has done little to
elucidate the matter. Evhen Olesnyts'kyi wrote that when he arrived
in Stryi in 1891, the peasantry in the surrounding countryside was
benighted and lacking in national or political consciousness. The
peasants listened to the priests and followed their example, for what
the priest said they considered sacred. 562 On the other hand, in 1912
a Polish author, the pseudonymous "Z.X.Y.," remarked that it was
not strange that the Ruthenians' "respect" for the Greek-Catholic
priest was like that of the schismatics for their p.. For the peasants
trusted the landlord or the Jew or even the Radical more than their
parish priest. In every parish, he claimed, the sacristan or the
parish council opposed the pastor. In every secular activity --
political, eduitiona1, economic -- the priest was being pushed aside,
or else kept on merely for appearances. Often at meetings one could
hear the slogan, "Away with the priests!"563
        This description resembles the relations between clergy and
intelligentsia described in the preceding section. Was it typical of the
priest's relations with his peasant faithful? Certainly conflicts did
occur in the economic sphere, and those should be examined first.
        In a January 1901 pastoral letter to the clergy "On the Dignity
and Obligations of Priests," Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi declared that
the clergy must come closer to the people, so that they might "fill the
562   Olesnytskyi, Evhen. Storinkv z moho zhtia. L'viv, 1935. Part II, 21.

chasm that because of differing social status could divide the priests
from the faithful." In particular, the priest must allow his own
feelings of mercy to be awakened by a closer familiarity with the
plight of the peasantry:
               Let him once enter a smoky hut where the
      poor live; let him look at the hard bed on which they
      sleep; let him take a breath of the close air which they
      breathe; let him touch those hands, black and
      cracked from hard labour, of people who are his
      brothers; let him taste a piece of the dry bread which
      is their sustenance; let him ask how much they earn
      a day, what they live from, what their work is like,
      what are their entertainments, their pleasures.564

       Marxist authors have made much of the economic conflicts
between the Greek-Catholic clergy and their parishioners. 565 Priests
commonly hired labourers to help till their land, or rented it out --
often to the wealthier peasants, since the poor could not be counted
on to pay the rent. In such a situation, occasional disputes were
inevitable. 566 The contrasts in wealth between some priests and some
peasants aroused resentment. Oleksander Bryk recounts that in his
village of Kolodiivka, the priest had a nice rectory and large farm
buildings, 60 morg y (about 30 hectares) of land, and hired three
permanent labourers in addition to three female servants, as well as
seasonal workers in the summer. The state paid him a supplement
of 200 forms a year to bring his income up to the guaranteed
minimum. With more than a hint of irony, Bryk recalls that when on
the priest's initiative the congregation built a new church, the priest
was rewarded by being elevated to canon.567
       The main source of economic conflict between priest and
peasant, however, were the sacramental fees (treby or iura stolae; see
Chapter Three). In the village of Balyntsi, the parish priest who
preceded Fr. Tyt Voinarovs'kyi had alienated his parishioners in the
1890s by striking a peasant for giving him less than the customary

payment for blessing a house. The peasants had thereafter punished
those of the community who would order masses from this priest.568
As was seen in Chapter One, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi warned the
L'viv seminarians in September 1901 that they must not expect to live
as burdens upon their parishes -- as pastors who milk and shear
their sheep but cannot tend them. 569 In his January 1901 pastoral
letter to the clergy he had warned his priests that they might have to
make sacrifices in order to avoid giving the people an impression of
greed. Priests must not make their services conditional on
contributions by the faithful, lest they become merchants dealing in
holy things.570
        These admonitions regarding excessive sacramental fees did
not eliminate the problem. In February 1912 Fr. E. Krynyts'kyi,
reporting to the Peremyshi' episcopal ordinariat on the Tartakiv
deanery meeting, remarked that when a Greek-Catholic priest
raised his sacramental fees, he might discover that a Russophile
agitator or schismatic priest, enjoying Russian financial support,
had promised to perform the sacraments free of charge. In a letter
written in the following month Fr. Anatolii Beskyd, dean at laslo,
remarked that "we must beat our breasts" for the excessive charges
for pastoral services.571 Evidently sensitive to the problem, in 1927 the
Peremyshl' episcopal ordinariat sent a circular letter to its parish
priests recommending moderation in taking sacramental fees, since
misunderstandings might lead to apostasy, and warning that it
would strictly apply canonical regulations to priests who demanded
excessive fees.572 Another warning was published in the eparchial
bulletin in 1931, noting that the number of complaints from the
faithful had increased. With falling prices and unemployment, they
had come upon hard times, and priests should defer to them. 573 In
February 1934, a pseudonymous 70-year-old priest wrote in Nyva

that there were many materialists among the clergy, who sometimes
demanded "mercilessly high payments for church trebv." In this
time of material and spiritual crisis, such individuals stood out in
sharp relief, and one or two of them in a town or a deanery sufficed to
hinder the work of the rest of the local clergy.574
       The problem of sacramental fees eventually may have abated
somewhat. At a meeting of the Komarno deanery on 8 June 1939, Fr.
Roman Honchuk gave a talk on the proper conduct of a priest with
doubters, free-thinkers and sectarians in which he described the
economic situation in the deanery. Sacramental fees, he felt, were
not as much of a problem as some laymen would like to think, for the
clergy had learned not to ask too much and had adapted to economic
circumstances. Since the amounts of sacramental fees were not
fixed by law, he added, one had to adapt to local customs and to the
ability of the faithful to pay. In any case, one must avoid conflicts
with the parish.575
       Lay perceptions of clerical wealth were not necessarily any
more or less accurate than the clergy's impression of its own poverty
(see Chapter Three). Fr. Honchuk observed:
             Nevertheless, in most parishes the status of
          priest is an object of envy. When the faithful see
          that the benefice fields are larger, and barns
          perhaps somewhat bigger than theirs, they
          think that priests are rich. But the material
          state of a pastor has greatly worsened.

       Agriculture had become unprofitable due to the high costs of
cultivation, high taxes, and low prices for farm products.
Furthermore, income from various priestly services, and customary
payments in kind, had fallen.576
       Parish economics were only one aspect of the clergy's
relations with the village, though perhaps the most problematical.
Peasant attitudes in matters of faith and morals, while more
important from the Church's point of view, are difficult to divine. As
is so often the case, most of the evidence comes from outsiders --
including those purporting to speak on the peasants' behalf --
whether priests or secular intelligentsia.

       At the February 1912 meeting of the Mokriany deanery at
Hrushiv, the gathered priests expressed the view that the
intelligentsia's indifference to religion had begun to affect the
villagers. Furthermore, schoolchildren and university students on
holiday at their families' farms were sowing the seeds of anti-
religious teachings, and often "in one blow destroy the work of the
parish priest." 577 At the Sambir deanery meeting in May of 1939, Fr.
D. Kuzmins'kyi, speaking on "How to Raise the Village from
Religious-Moral Decline," blamed poverty, Bolshevik and Radical
agitation, and the laziness and bad examples of some priests for the
sorry state of affairs.578
       Greek-Catholic priests, who to an increasing extent came
from the peasant-farming community, were well aware of the
economic hardships of village life. They thus could continue the
socio-economic work so typical of their nineteenth-century
predecessors with an additional zeal derived from experience. The
clergy of the Stanyslaviv eparchy were urged to take the lead in such
work by their then Bishop Andrei Sheptyts'kyi in 1899. Typical of
socio-economic work was the founding of reading-rooms, discussed
above, as well as of temperance societies, agricultural cooperatives,
financial institutions, insurance funds, and cultural circles. The
efforts of individual priests in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries are well documented. 580 The clergy also participated in
public relief efforts. For example, the Ukrainian Committee for Aid
to the Unemployed and the Poor, based in L'viv and presided over by
a layman, enjoyed the patronage of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and
Bishops Kotsylovs'kyi and Khomyshyn. At the parish level, the priest

or his assistant would appoint lay helpers to carry on the
Committee's charitable work.58'
      The clergy's socio-economic work was sometimes criticised.
In 1899, Metropolitan Sas-Kuilovs'kyi chided parish priests for
founding reading-rooms, which he regarded as harmful. 582 The
clergy's concern with socio-economic affairs could be perceived as a
symptom of their secularisation. 583 In 1937, a priest of the
Stanyslaviv eparchy described the early years of the century, when
the "reading-room fever" had reached its height, in the following
words:
            Each tried to outdo the other in founding as
          many reading-rooms as possible and to have as
          many as possible under his influence.
            Let those of us who are older, who were
          witnesses to this, recall how at times such
          activist priests neglected even the most essential
          pastoral obligations at the altar and in the pulpit
          and the confessional, and let us pass this on to
          those who are younger, who never saw all this,
          but who now are reaping its bitter harvest. How
          many Masses were shortened then, or rather
          rattled off, how many vespers, sermons, and
          catechisms were omitted, how many people were
          sent away from the confessionals, because the
          "reading-room priests" were in a hurry to get to
          the rally, to a secular poll, to a meeting, to a
          session. When the season of reading-room events
          arrived, then on Sundays and holidays the
          "activist priest" only had time to serve Mass
          early in the morning, and beyond this he was
          always outside the parish. -- He knocked about
          the most remote corners, for to miss any
          "reading-room meeting," poll, rally, or "popular
          festival" was considered a major crime and
          misdemeanor. It was fitting, as it were, "to be
          with the people" always and everywhere, in
          order to give people a good example and to
          encourage them! .584

      As discussed above, excessive clerical engagement with the
reading-room movement also came under criticism (at least in the
Stamyslaviv eparchy) because in the hands of the intelligentsia, that

movement had been turned against the clergy. However, it is not
clear whether these conflicts between priests and intelligentsia
involved the peasants as well.
       The Greek-Catholic priest participated in the life of the village
in a variety of other ways. For example, he might serve as the local
notary. 585 To some extent he took part in social life. The Old
Ruthenian clergy's social life in the Stryi deanery in the 1890s
described in the previous chapter, however, presumably involved
middle-class laity rather than peasants. This may have changed
with the demographic changes in twentieth-century Galicia. In the
village of Khorobriv near Sokal', Fr. Mykhailo Zheplyns'kyi was
popular because he did not refuse invitations to the festivities
accompanying christenings and weddings. His successor, Fr. Osyp
Pshepiurs'kyi, was not well received by his parishioners because of
his Polish-sounding name -- despite the fact that he had served as a
chaplain in the Ukrainian Galician Army. Eventually, however, he
was accepted, and his wife Iryna was particularly well liked because
of her participation in the villagers' amateur musical and theatrical
life and in the Ukrainian Women's League.586
       Some priests continued to maintain a distance from the village
population. This was often true of the remnants of the predominantly
Old Ruthenian or Russophile caste. Oleksander Bryk recounts that
in the early 1900s, the villagers regarded the priest as a government
official who had nothing in common with them besides the
fulfillment of his duties. They considered him part of the gentry. The
fact that the local Poles, who referred to the villagers as rusini-
kabany ("Ruthenian wild pigs"), considered the priest (a celibate) an
exceptional porzdnv rusin ("proper Ruthenian"), hardly endeared
him to them. Furthermore, the priest did not once set foot in the
reading-room -- and was not expected to. To his credit, however, he

was elected notary in 1912. The episcopal consistory in Peremyshi ' asked him to
resign, since the position did not comport with priestly dignity. However, Fr.
Isaichyk argued that it was better that he be notary instead of his predecessor, a
Jewish tavern-keeper who exploited the people and plied them with liquor during
civic meetings. Fr. Isaichyk was supported in this by his dean, Fr. Anatolii
Beskyd of the laslo (Jas4o) deanery. The episcopal consistory seems to have
accepted his argument, albeit with some reservations.

did give 25 kreuzer to Christmas carollers who were collecting for
the reading-room.587
        The separate and superior social status characteristic of the
Old Rutheman priests gradually ceded to populist egalitarianism.
After all 40 priests at a deanery meeting in F1'orynka in 1898 had
agreed to join the Ruthenian Hostel Society in Nowy Scz, a general
meeting was held, attended by 42 priests, 25 ladies, 119 peasants and
 18 peasant women. At the "memorable" dinner, peasants cried with
joy and went home to tell their families how "for the first time they
had dined with the iegomosti. ieimosti and gentlemen at the same
table."588 At the same time, sensitivity to their social status relative to
town and village did not altogether disappear among the Greek-
Catholic clergy even after the world war. Fr. Stefan Harasovs'kyi told
his fellow priests from the Belz deanery in June of 1927 that "in town.
the parishioners would be scandalised to see their pastor behind a
plough, but in the village they are more understanding in this
respect, though they are not edified by such an example!" 589 One can
compare the complaint of the mid-nineteenth-century Russian
parish priest I.S. Belliustin that a priest who had to plough the land
and haul manure could hardly maintain an attitude of dignity before
his parishioners.590
       The clergy occasionally were the object of social criticism for
their alleged moral hypocrisy. Fr. Iuliian Dzerovych, noting in his
article in Nyva that the clergy's errors were the subjects of
newspaper articles, books, and even theatrical performances, replied
that priests had the same failings as laymen, and should not be
judged more harshly, nor should the faults of a few be ascribed to the
many. Furthermore, the clerical state treated its wrongdoers more
severely. It was unfair for the laity to condenm in the clergy what it
condoned among its own.591 At the Belz deanery meeting referred to

above, Fr. Stefan Harasovs'kyi reminded the gathered priests to
warn his children and servants against sin, to encourage them to
pray, and in the evenings to read religious-moral books to them
aloud.592
       Political differences were naturally a source of conflict
between priest and parish. Fr. Tyt Voinarovs'kyi was among those
who could overcome such differences. Upon arriving in 1894 in the
parish of Balyntsi, where the Radicals were influential, he began to
patiently discuss politics with his parishioners. Soon they were
visiting him every Sunday afternoon to talk over what they had read
in the Radical newspapers. Having himself carefully read each
newspaper, Fr. Voinarovs'kyi was prepared for the debate, and
eventually succeeded in refuting every Radical idea brought up by
his parishioners that was contrary to Christian teaching. Thus, he
recounted in his memoir, the Radicals lost their following in
Balyntsi. 593 When the future bishop Fr. Hryhorii Khomyshyn arrived
in Kolomyia in the Stanyslaviv eparchy, he found the town almost
totally Radicalised. The intelligentsia rarely attended church, and a
few were declared atheists. A number treated priests as equals or
even inferiors, particularly if they did not belong to their political
party. To gain the support of the intelligentsia, a priest often had to be
active in party life, to the detriment of the Church. However, Fr.
Khomyshyn succeeded in attracting the intelligentsia with the
quality of his preaching.594
       Conflicts between clergy and laity occasionally broke out over
the issue of ritual and cultural orientation (see the following
chapter). In January 1913, eight parishioners in Mokrotyn in the
Peremyshl' eparchy lodged a complaint against their priest, Fr.
Dionizii Dombrovs'kyi, on account of his Russophile behaviour. In
particular, he had allegedly dissolved the parish Apostolate of Prayer
because this was "Polish," and had ordered his faithful to stop using
rosaries because this constituted polonisation of the people. He had
discontinued services to the Sacred Heart, supplications and
Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament, since these were borrowings

from the Latin rite, and had even replaced the metal cross on the
altar with a wooden three-barred cross. Fr. Dombrovs'kyi had
apparently alienated some of his parishioners by circulating
Russophile newspapers like "Holos Naroda," and had spoken
against the Basilians and their newspaper "Misionar," telling the
people not to visit their monastery at Zhovkva. He had opposed the
local branch of the "Sich" gymnastic association on the ground that
it was a Radical group, and had publicly chided girls for attending
its gatherings. Finally, he had dissolved the choir because of its
"Sich" sympathies. The parish was demoralised, stated the
complaint, and the temperance society showed no signs of life.595
       Of course, the historical record contains instances of excellent
relations between priest and parish. In 1933, for example, 33
parishioners from Stare Selo wrote to the Bishop of Peremyshi'
asking that Fr. Mykhailo Dochylo's transfer to another parish be
revoked. Reminding the Bishop of the sectarian and Communist
influences at work in the eparchy, as well as the polonisation of the
village youth, they pointed out Fr. Dochylo's many accomplishments.
Now their church was decorated with flowers and embroidery, and a
collection had been taken up for a new church. The priest was
popular with the children, who now attended services eagerly. He
had helped to improve the state of the local cooperative, put the
church choir in order, and with his sermons had drawn young
people away from Communist agitators and back to the Church. One
no longer heard secular songs in the village during Lent, young men
took their hats off before their elders, and not one person had joined
the Baptists. In the neighbouring parish of Myl'kiv, also served by Fr.
Dochylo, even the Poles had begun attending the Greek-Catholic
church in order to hear his sermons.596
       Apart from the conflicts of the 1920s between clergy and
intelligentsia in the Stanyslaviv eparchy, relations between the
members of "Prosvita" reading-rooms and the Greek-Catholic clergy
were usually friendly. Members of the "Prosvita" branch at
Hrebenets' joined with other villagers in March of 1933 to request the
Peremyshi' Episcopal Consistory to send them a permanent priest.
Although the local Russophiles desired only an Orthodox priest, and

others did not want one at all because they did not wish to give up the
use of the parish lands, the authors of the letter felt that a permanent
priest was particularly important because of Baptist proselytising.
Fr. Kliufas, who only visited occasionally, would be welcome, despite
his large family. 597 In February 1937, members of the "Prosvita"
reading-room in Uhertsi Nezabytovs'ki requested the Episcopal
Consistory in Peremyshi' to keep Fr. Vasyl' Paslavs'kyi in their
parish, because of his fine religious and educational work. The
church brotherhood now had 250 members and received many
religious publications at the reading-room. Fr. Paslavs'kyi had taken
up a collection to cover the belfry with tin, and funds were being
collected to build a church hail, which the parishioners needed for
meetings of the brotherhood and for "religious-national
presentations." 598 The head and secretary of the "Prosvita" reading-
room at Pavlova wrote to Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi in early 1937 on behalf
of the parish youth of Maidan Syniavs'kyi (Majdan Sieniawski),
asking for a priest. He would have to be fearless, they wrote, since the
Ukrainians were in danger of being polonised through the local
Latin-rite church, while on the other hand the influence of the
Communists was spreading too. What was needed was an educated,
hard-working priest who loved his people.599
       Relations between a pastor and his flock could be complex, so
that trivial matters sometimes assumed great importance. Among
the various issues dividing Fr. Volodymyr Prystai and his parish at
Vyslok Horishnyi in 1932-1933 were the accounts involving the
purchase of sacramental wine, the state of the parish land and
hedges, and a speech defect that impeded the priest's preaching.
Meanwhile, the parish was threatened by sectarian and Communist
agitation. Furthermore, the village elder opposed Fr. Prystai because
after the elder had refused to have the village girls wash the floor of
the church, the priest's wife had stopped sending him milk or
presents on the occasion of the slaughtering of pigs -- both
apparently local customs. Some of the conflicts at Vyslok Horishnyi
also involved the parish council, an institution established under

Austrian law and continued during the period of Polish
administration.600
       It would appear that as the Greek-Catholic parish clergy
abandoned Russophile ideology and gradually came to accept
populist and nationalist ideas, their relations with the village
improved. The influx of peasants' sons into the clergy may also have
contributed to mutual understanding.
      The priest arriving at his urban or rural parish faced a host of
hardships in his relations with the laity, whether intelligentsia or
villagers. On the whole, these harships were never eliminated. The
seminary memoirs of Fr. Nykolai Voiakovs'kyi, who was ordained in
1925 and served as parish priest near Horodok from 1927 to 1939,
mention that the Greek-Catholic clergy had to endure "derision and
ironic treatment, pointed jeers, malicious criticism and hurtful
needling." 60 ' As late as January 1939, the editors of Nyva -- in the
midst of a comment on the conflict with Bishop Khomyshyn --
described the life of the Greek-Catholic clergy in the following words:
             Today our clergy is so humbled, so humiliated,
           all kinds of moral and material blows assail it
           from all sides, its name is blackened in the
           press, denunciations rain down upon it, lawsuits
           are conducted against it, heavy money fines are
           imposed upon it, about which our daily press
           reports constantly and of which [the clergy] does
           not need to be maliciously reminded to its
           humiliation. We would like to find another such
           clergy in the world that suffers so much
           humiliation, so much derision and
           debasement!602

     Written in the heat of polemic, this description is no doubt
exaggerated. It may have been valid only as to a part of the clergy,
and only in some times and places. Yet it echoes Fr. Iuliian
Dzerovych's comment of 1912, quoted at the beginning of this chapter,
and Fr. Vasyl' Pryshliak's complaint of 1935, quoted in the
preceding one. It conveys something of the social atmosphere in
which the Greek-Catholic parish priest lived, worked, and thought.

It is in this atmosphere that the ideas to be discussed in the following
two chapters were developed, debated and put into practice.
        Neither the problem of clerical relations with a secular
intelligentsia and a politically awakening peasantry in a time of
secularisation and nationalism, nor the attempted solutions
described above, were exclusively Galician phenomena. Similar
problems and approaches are to be found in other Catholic as well as
Orthodox contexts, and indeed in non-Christian societies with a
strong traditional clergy. The kind of stress between clerical and
secular elites vying for popular support -- and between them and the
masses -- described above and in Chapter Eight are typical of
societies undergoing modernisation.
         PART THREE: CRISES OF IDENTITY
          CHAPTER SIX: RELIGIOUS, NATIONAL
              AND POLITICAL IDENTITY
       The period 1900-1939 saw the transformation of the Greek-
Catholic clergy. In part, this was a conscious transformation,
beginning with the reform of the seminary (see Chapters One and
Two) and continuing with attempts to modernise the clergy and
bring it closer to the Ruthenian and then Ukrainian popular
movement. In part, this transformation consisted of a series of
clerical responses to changing conditions such as the secularisation
of Ruthenian-Ukrainian society, economic hardship, the rise of the
village intelligentsia, the sharpening of political conflicts with the
Poles, and the growth of militant nationalism. Running parallel
with the development of Ukrainian national consciousness, the
clerical transformation interacted with it. Both processes were
affected by (and sometimes contributed to) political events such as
the world war, the creation of a short-lived Western Ukrainian
Republic, and the war with Poland. 603 The conditions and events of
this turbulent period compelled the Greek-Catholic priest to make
difficult practical choices, which in turn forced him to define his
moral and political principles more sharply, though always in the
light of the Church's teachings and the directives of the hierarchy.
In this process, the clergy redefined their cultural orientation, their
national identity, and their political stance. In short, during this
period they developed a somewhat revised world view, a prominent
feature of which was a new sense of their own identity.
       This identity, forged through "crisis" or choice, had several
aspects with their own paths of development. In the first decades of
the century, the Old Ruthenian cultural tendency of much of the
clergy culminated in political Russophilism and religious schism.
Both these tendencies waned among the clergy after the debacle of
the first world war, raising the necessity of a new orientation.
Gradually, the clergy adopted a Ukrainian national identity. As
Ukrainian national consciousness became associated with various
political movements, the clergy searched for its place in the

                            183

changing political landscape. At the same time, Galician
Ukrainians sought a cultural expression for their newly discovered
national identity. The clergy took part in this search, seeking a
specifically Ukrainian Catholic orientation, which was both cultural
and religious.

1. Old Ruthenians. Russophiles. Schismatics

        The oldest members of the Greek-Catholic clergy in 1900 had
been ordained at the birth of the Old Ruthenian or Russophile
movement. This movement was a response th a change in the policy
of the Habsburg monarchy and in the balance of power in Austrian
Galicia. In the first half of the nineteenth century, the government
had favoured the Ruthenians and their Greek-Catholic Church as a
counterweight to the Poles and their Church organisation. The
Ruthenians and their hierarchy consequently behaved with the
greatest loyalty to the Emperor, earning the epithets of Kaisertreu
and "Tyroleans of the East." In the period of constitutionalism,
however, imperial policy began to change, and in the era of Galician
autonomy (after 1867) the Poles clearly had the upper hand in
Galician politics, achieving considerable influence in Vienna as
well. 604
        Deprived of imperial support and helpless before the dominant
Polish gentry and growing middle class, some of the Ruthenians
began to look to Russia for support. From the 1860s, the Greek-
Catholic higher clergy, centered at St. George's Cathedral in L'viv
adopted a Russophile orientation. This movement, whose members
came to be known as "Old Ruthenians," had political and religious
implications. 605 Politically, it carried the tacit threat of intervention

literaturnyi sbornik Galitsko-Russkoi Matitsy. L'vov, 1930, 11-21. Fr. Polianskyi
was born in 1854 at Smol'nyk in Galicia. Upon completing his studies at the
Lviv seminary in 1877 he married, and after ordination served as assistant
priest in Komarno. In 1882 he became a prefect at the L'viv seminary, and
chairman of the editorial commission of the Kachkovskii Society, a Russophile
popular-educational organisation that formed reading-rooms throughout Galicia.
He taught religion in a secondary school in Drohobych and served as parish
priest in different villages. Fr. Polianskyi's selected works were published in
Moscow in 1915 under the editorship of F.F. Aristov, in the series Biblioteka
Karoato-Russkikh Pisatelei.

by a major rival of the Habsburgs. This threat was taken seriously
enough by the Austrian authorities to provoke treason trials in 1882
and 1914. Religiously, it bore the related implication of Orthodox
sympathies -- which became a reality when emigre Galician clergy
under Fr. Markiel Pope!' participated in the liquidation of the Union
in Russian-held Kholm (Che1m) in 1875, and when Fr. Ivan
Naumovych joined the Orthodox Church along with the entire
Galician village of Hnylychky (Skalat district) in 1882.
       However, the Russophilism of the Old Ruthenians was
primarily a cultural movement, rarely involving religious apostasy
or political disloyalty. 606 In part it was a reaction against the Polish
cultural orientation that much of the Ruthenian Greek-Catholic
clergy had adopted in previous decades. In part it was an attempt to
stave off poloriisation in both the secular and church domains in an
era of Polish dominance in virtually all spheres of Galician life.607
The movement set up its own network of reading-rooms under the
auspices of the Kachkovsky Society, set up in 1874. It was culturally
conservative, however, in the sense that it favoured using the
"etymological" rather than the phonetic orthography. This was also
a reflection of its politically conservative, anti-populist stance. Rather
than seeking to write in a manner that conveyed popular speech, the
Old Ruthenians used an artificial written language incorporating
elements of Church Slavonic and Russian. Incomprehensible to the
masses (and comical to the new secular intelligentsia), it became the
written language of much of the priestly class well into the twentieth
century. In the strictly religious sphere, Russophilism included a
movement for purification of the Greek-Catholic rite, which at least
since the Synod of Zamoé in 1720 had undergone gradual

606     At a February 1912 meeting of the Zhovkva (Zdlkiew) deanery -- one of the
extraordinary deanery meetings called to discuss, among other things, the
danger of schism -- Fr. Petro Durkot, apparently an Old Ruthenian, complained
that the Basilians were publicly accusing local Old Ruthenian priests of tending
to schism. Wojewddzkie Archiwum Pañstwowe w Przeinylu (WAP-P),
Archiwum Biskupstwa Grecko-Katolickiego (ABGK) file 3848.
607 At a meeting of the Liubachiv (Lubaczdw) deanery on 27 February 1912, at
which schismatic and Radical agitation were discussed, Fr. Severyn Metellia
introduced a resolution to the effect that schismatic agitation was caused not by
Orthodox agitators or priests, but by political relations: Polish church periodicals
like 'PrzeglQd Powszechny' and "Gazeta Kocielna" evinced a disdainful and
even hostile attitude towards the Greek-Catholic Church and clergy, which
caused the Ruthenian people to seek to protect their nationality from aggressive
polonisation, even to the extent of throwing themselves into the arms of schism.
WAP-P, ABGK file 3848.
                            185

"latinisation." 608 In general terms, the Russian orientation afforded
Ruthenians, both lay and clerical, at least a sense of power through
identification as a branch of the numerous and mighty Russian
nation. 609
        According to an Austrian military source, in 1909 one-third of
the Ruthemans in Eastern Galicia were Russophile, two-thirds
Ukrainophile. 610 According to Cyrille Korolevskij, when Andrei
Sheptyts'kyi ascended to the metropolitan see of Halych in 1901, the
Russophiles, composed of clergy and intelligentsia, constituted a
third of the population of the Peremyshi' eparchy, nearly a third of
that of the L'viv eparchy, and less than a third in the Stanyslaviv
eparchy.61'
        The Russophile movement naturally attracted the interest and
the generous financial support of imperial Russia. Scholarships
were provided for study in Russia, and student housing was
organised in various towns of Galicia. Pilgrimages were organised
to Kiev and to the monastery at Pochaiv (Pochaev), near the Galician
border. The Stauropegial Institute in L'viv became a Russophile
stronghold, and operated a major publishing house. The Ruthenian
National Home and the Galician Ruthenian Matitsa were the two
other major Russophile institutions.612
       The growth of Russophile sympathies among the Greek-
Catholic clergy alarmed the Viennese authorities and led to the
resignation of Metropolitan losyf Sembratovych in 1882. In that year,
a reform and revitalisation of the Basilian order, the traditional
source of bishops, was undertaken by the Jesuits. In 1885 Syl'vester
Sembratovych was elevated to the metropolitan throne. In 1891 a

provincial synod was held in L'viv to settle questions of ritual and
discipline. The Julian (Old) Calendar was retained, as was the
custom of ordaining married men. 613 To some extent clerical
Russophilism was brought under control in Galicia, although
individual Old Ruthenian priests survived up to World War Two.614
       In the Lemko region, an Orthodox movement continued well
into the twentieth century, with mass conversions from about 1911 to
1914. 615 Emigrants returning from the United States and Canada,
where the Russian Orthodox Church had made massive inroads
among the Ruthenian emigrant population, contributed to the
Orthodox movement in this region.
       Something of the life of Old Ruthenian parish priests was
described in Chapters Four and Five. As was discussed in Chapter
Three, this was a dying class. Although Old Ruthenians remained
dominant in the metropolitan and episcopal consistories and
cathedral chapters at least until the first world war, there, too, their
influence waned. The socio-economic factors in the demise of the
priestly caste were mentioned in Chapter Three. Priests' sons
entered the free professions; priestly life became harsher; the war
ruined some families, the recession others. The advent of
compulsory priestly celibacy ended prospects of a continuation of the

and twentieth centuries, see the article "Ruteni" in the Enciclooedia Cattolica

614 Parish priest Fr. I. Hnatyshak, asked to present a talk on "How we
should utilise the Jubilee of the Baptism of Rus'-Ukraine in Pastoral Work" at
the Nyzhankovychi deanery meeting of 17 November 1938, did not appear at the
meeting because he did not recognise Ukraine. Undaunted, his dean, Fr. Ivan
Sendzik, requested the episcopal ordinariat in Peremyshi' to have him write a
paper on this theme and read it at the following meeting. WAP-P, ABGK file
5575, p. 80. Fr. Hnatyshak was evidently an Old Ruthanian. At a deanery
meeting in the Stanyslaviv eparchy in December 1938, Fr. Evhen Chubatyi, an
Old Ruthenian from Svarychiv, got into an argument with one Fr. Kostiuk, a
Ukrainian nationalist, regarding the latter's sermon on the 950th anniversary
of the Baptism of Rus'. Fr. Kostiuk ended with the assertion that Old Ruthenian
priests were dying out, while consciously Ukrainian priests were taking the
fore. Archiwum Akt Nowych (AAN), Ministerstwo Wyznan Religijnych i
Oswiecenia Publicznego (MWR i OP) file 384, p. 156. Although it seems unlikely
that there should have been any causal connection between residual Galician
Russophilism and the absorption of the Greek-Catholic Church into the Russian
Orthodox Church in 1945-1946, this topic deserves exploration.
615 For example, in 1912 it was reported that the entire village of Dolhe, part
of the Radotsyn parish, which was under an Old Ruthenian priest, had converted

region. Nvva 1912, 98-99.

priestly dynasties, and many potential priests presumably were
 deterred from entering seminary.
       There were other reasons, however, for the decline of the Old
Ruthenians. These were connected with the development of the
Russophile tendency itself after 1900, and with the events of World
War One.
       Around the turn of the century the Old Ruthenians began to
lose ground to the "novokursnvk y ," a new generation of Russophiles
with a significantly different outlook. 616 The "novokursnvk y" took an
overtly political stance, identifying with the interests of the Russian
state.617 They were also more inclined to schism.
       Thus, the Old Ruthenian movement, originally conceived as a
means of cultural-ecclesiastical self-preservation consistent with
both Catholicism and loyalty to the Habsburg empire, gave birth to a
series of apostasies on the one hand, and to a disloyal political
orientation on the other. Both these tendencies reached their
consummation during the Russian invasions of World War One.
       The reaction of Polish society to these developments was
mixed. On the one hand, as mentioned in the Introduction, the
Polish clergy saw the Old Ruthenians as potential or even crypto-
schismatics. Some regarded their sympathies for Russia as proof
that their Catholicism was bogus. 618 This in turn provided a
rationale for converting the Ruthenians to the more "truly" Catholic
Latin rite. On the political side, some Polish nationalists recognised
Russophilism as an anti-Polish ideology, which sought the favour of
Poland's traditional enemy to the East. From 1900, however, the
newly emergent Polish National Democrats, a radically right-wing
nationalist movement headed by Roman Dmowski, tended to support
the Russophiles, as did the large landowners or "Podolians" of

Galicia, and a good part of the Latin-rite clergy. Politically, these
groups correctly saw the Russophile Old Ruthenians as a
conservative force opposed to both the Ukrainophile populists and the
socialist Radicals.619
       From its beginnings the Russophile movement competed with
the populist and socialist tendencies. As John-Paul Himka has
shown, Rutheriian populism took a turn for the moderate in the late
1860s, due to clerical influence. This resulted from the need of the
urban populist intellectuals for a bridge to the masses in the
countryside. Such a role could only be played by the parish priests,
who had access to the peasants and who by founding reading-rooms
and teaching the people to read made it possible for the populists,
and later the Radicals, to reach them. In exchange for this service,
the clergy exerted a tempering influence on the populist movement.
In the late 1880s,however, Radical populism asserted itself as a
militantly anti-clerical socialist force.62°
       Polish populism developed along similar lines in Galicia. The
"populist" or peasant movement led by Fr. Stojatowski in fact
exhibited anti-clerical tendencies as well as elements of socialism,
nationalism, and anti-Semitism. It was, however, not as socially
radical as its counterpart in the Russian partition, nor closely
comparable to nineteenth-century Russian populism. Polish
populism in Galicia generally represented the interests of landed
peasants. In inter-war Poland the "Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe"
would become an influential if ideologically amorphous party which
contributed men like Wincenty Witos and Stanislaw Mikolajczyk.621
       In 1899, a number of Ruthenian right Radicals and populists
formed the National Democratic Party which in its various
subsequent incarnations became the dominant party in Ruthenian
and Ukrainian Galician politics for the next forty years. However,
the Radicals remained a force, with some eventually joining the
Communists and others forming the Ukrainian Socialist Radical
Party. The Social Democratic and Social Christian parties exerted
less influence. All of these, however, opposed the novokursnvkv, both

for their social conservatism and for their rejection of the Ukrainian
orientation.
       Despite Polish support, the Russophiles began to lose their
political influence as suffrage was extended in Austria. The 1907
reform of the electoral system in Parliament enabled the populists to
gain at the expense of the Russophiles. After the assassination of
Viceroy Potocki by a Ukrainophile student in April 1908, his
successor Michal Bobrzyfiski discontinued the policy of supporting
the Russophiles, pursuing a more even-handed policy which allowed
the populists to assert themselves. In particular, he took steps which
culminated, with Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's cooperation, in the
electoral reform finally enacted under the next viceroy, Witold
Korytowski, in January 1914.622
       It has been asserted that as Bishop of Stanyslaviv in 1899-1900,
Sheptyts'kyi favoured the Russophiles. 623 It appears that as
Metropolitan, he maintained a neutral stance. The Russophiles did
control the higher ecclesiastical posts in Galicia. The populists, on
the other hand, were hostile to Sheptyts'kyi despite his actions on
behalf of the Ruthenian cause. Furthermore, populism was still
associated with anti-clericalism, though by this time there were
many populist priests as well. The Metropolitan's condemnation of
the 1908 assassination of the Viceroy Potocki was resented by many
lay populists. 624 His order of 27 August 1908 forbidding priests to
interfere in each other's parishes was interpreted as being directed
against populist priests conducting activity in the parishes of their
Russophile neighbours. Nevertheless, a rapprochement between
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and the populists took place in the years
preceding the first world war.
        At the same time, Orthodox agitation evidently prompted the
Metropolitan to warn against the dangers of schism in a pastoral
letter of 31 March 1910. 625 Bishop Khomyshyn did likewise in 1911.626

In early 1912, the Peremyshi' episcopal ordinariat requested all
deans to hold special meetings at which, among other things, the
Metropolitan's 1910 letter would be read, and parish priests would
report on any schismatic agitation in their parishes. 627 In July, 1912
the Metropolitan Ordinariat in L'viv ordered deans and parish
priests to try to prevent pilgrimages across the Russian border to
Pochaiv and to report any that were being planned; it also asked the
clergy to use the political authorities to weed out schismatic
agitators. The priests were reminded that they must teach the
faithful the difference between Catholicism and schism, and deans
were urged to arrange for missions in their deaneries. The matter of
schism was to be given foremost attention at deanery meetings.628
      Russophilism thus came to be identified with schism, and
most of the Greek-Catholic clergy began to follow Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi's lead in abandoning it. Gradually, they adopted a
populist and then an outright nationalist orientation. 629 At the same
time, the need to preserve the Eastern tradition and to stave off
polonisation and latinisation -- a need which lay at the heart of the
Russophile movement -- came to be satisfied under Sheptyts'kyi's
guidance in a way that avoided absorption into Russian Orthodoxy.
This was the way of Church Union, which will be discussed below.630
      In September 1914 the Russian army arrived in Galicia. The
rapidly retreating Austrians rounded up and hanged suspected
Russophiles, including priests. Several hundred Greek-Catholic
priests were deported to detention camps in Thalerhof,

those who oppose frequent communion and devotions to the Sacred Heart. It also
asserts that the Catholic faith, unlike that of the schismatics, is truly "Orthodox,"
and that the Union of 1596 was a voluntary reunion of the Ruthenians with the
One Church of Rome, which was the Church of St. Vladimir and various other
Eastern saints.

Theresienstadt and Gmund. 63 ' Some authors allege that this was
due to denunciations by Poles. 632 Russophiles allege that it was the
Ukrainian party, inc1uding some of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's
associates, who were responsible for the "Galician Golgotha."633
        The Russian occupation of Galicia lasted several months
from the autumn of 1914 to the spring of 1915; Russian forces held
parts of Galicia into 1916, and made further gains as a result of the
Brusilov offensive in that year. During this time, the civil
administration treated the Ruthenian population fairly leniently.
However, Archbishop Evlogii of Voihynia attempted to carry through
a mass conversion of the Greek-Catholics to the Orthodox Church,
with the cooperation of the Russophiles. He sent Orthodox clergy to
take over parishes abandoned by Greek-Catholic priests who had fled
before the Russians or been arrested by the Austrians. In fact, the
Russian civil authorities were annoyed by his measures and sought
to restrain him. 634 In the event, a number of priests (perhaps 50) did

opposed Evlogii's "tactless agitation" for Orthodoxy. Dmytro Doroshenko, who
represented the Russian government in Galicia, relates that Bobrinskii
complained in a report that Evlogii had ignored his orders, appointing priests to
parishes where only a few people had requested one. By April 1915 Evlogii had
created 113 Orthodox parishes in Galicia, and during the next two months the

convert, along with all or part of various villages, particularly in the
border region of eastern Galicia. When the Russians retreated, a
number of priests and faithful who had converted to Orthodoxy fled
with them, fearing Austrian reprisals. 635 For others, however, the
Russian occupation brought disillusionment. The reality of the often
poorly educated Russian clergy, insensitive to Ruthenian traditions
and sensibilities, and speaking a language that sounded more
foreign than it appeared on paper, dispelled the Russophile
dream.636
       Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi himself was arrested by the Russian
authorities in September 1914 and deported to Russia, to be released
in 1917.637 By the time of his return to L'viv in 1918 he was hailed by
Galician Ukrainians as a national hero. On 21 February of that year,
he and Bishops Khomyshyn and Kotsylovs'kyi issued a joint pastoral
letter criticising the Russophile ideology and urging their priests to



number nearly doubled. After the Russian offensive of 1916, however, Evlogii
was not allowed to continue his campaign for the conversion of Galicia.

adopt the Ukrainian orientation of their faithful. 638 At the same
time, the downfall of Tsarist Russia rendered political Russophilism
virtually irrelevant; after the Bolshevik take-over, it became pointless,
at least for the clergy. 639 It has also been argued that Russophilism
was a moribund philosophy in that it could not absorb the
"revolutionaries" of the younger generation, something which vital
movements are always able to do. 64 ° Furthermore, the end of Tsarist
funding of the Russophile movement removed one of its chief
supports. The fact that in Russian Ukraine, Tsarism had been
supplanted in 1917 by a Ukrainian People's Republic which declared
independence in January 1918 aroused public enthusiasm in Galicia
and vindicated the populist cause. A Western Ukrainian People's
Republic was formed in October 1918, followed by struggle with
Poland over Galicia. All this tended to eclipse Russophile
aspirations. Gradually, Old Ruthenian priests began to go over to the
Ukrainian camp.
       While the Old Ruthenians were on the wane in most of Galicia
(albeit retaining the Stauropegial Institute and publishing house
and the People's Home in L'viv), in the Lemko region, the western
section of the Peremyshi' eparchy, the Old Ruthenian clergy and its
Russophile ideology persisted. Perhaps in reaction to Latin-rite and
Polish pressures, as well as to the imposition of compulsory priestly
celibacy in 1925, there was a wave of Orthodox schism in the late
1920s. Some 20 parishes joined the Orthodox Church. 641 This was
reinforced by Lemko separatist tendencies and a reaction against the

hectoring of Ukrainian nationalists -- including priests -- from
Eastern Galicia. 642 The Orthodox movement was sufficiently
alarming to the Catholic Church to warrant creation of a special
Apostolic Administration in 1934.643
       The Lemko Apostolic Administration appears to have been the
product of the confluence of interests of the Roman Catholic Church
and the Polish government. The government sought to prevent
Ukrainian nationalist influences from entering this area; it was
known that Bishop Kotyslovs'kyi had been sending Ukrainian
nationalist priests to the Lemko region. 644 The Roman Catholic
Church, for its part, saw the need for direct supervision where there
was a danger of mass apostasy. Both the political isolation of the
Lemko region and religious control from Rome would be served by
the creation of the new administrative entity. Of course, the Holy See
and the Polish government also had conflicting aims: the former
wished to preserve Greek Catholicism in the area, while the latter
preferred the advancement of Orthodoxy. Whether the Lemko
Apostolic Administration was a success from either point of view is
difficult to determine, as it had only five years before the German
occupation of these lands irrevocably changed the situation.

Catholic and dispel his sympathies for Orthodoxy." I.H. "Dvadtsiat lit na

(However, the tendency to join the Orthodox Church continues to this
day as a limitation on Latin-rite pressure upon Greek-Catholics in
this region, while the tradition of government support for the
Orthodox Church as a counter-weight to Catholicism of either rite
continues, if anything, more strongly than before.)
       Thus, the cultural Russophilism of the Old Ruthenian clergy
found both its apogee and its demise in its ultimate political and
religious consequences. Identification with Imperial Russia died in
the first world war. Apostasy and flight to Russia obviously meant
leaving the Greek-Catholic priesthood. A number of Old Ruthenian
priests died in Austrian internment camps. The passing of
ideological Russophilism coincided with the fall of the priestly
dynasties and the departure of their scions from the priesthood. A
harmless cultural Old Ruthenianism lingered among the elder
Galician clergy. Only in the Lemko region did religious
Russophilism remain strong. While Orthodox conversions occurred
among the Lemko laity, the Russophile clergy in that region
remained staunchly Greek-Catholic. In the meantime, the majority
of the Greek-Catholic priests in Galicia adopted the Ukrainian
national orientation.

2. From Ruthenian Populists to Ukrainian Nationalists

       As has been seen above, much of the populist movement, and
particularly its Radical current, was anti-clerical, and relations
between Church and intelligentsia were often hostile. Even the
growing number of populist priests could not accept the tenets of the
laymen with whom they worked in enlightening the village. Yet by
1939, when Ruthenian populists had become Ukrainian nationalists,
the Greek-Catholic clergy were almost entirely in the Ukrainian
national camp. How did this happen?
       The answer lies in changes that occurred among both the
clergy and the populist movement, as well as in external political
events. As Russophilism of the Old Ruthenian variety waned and
that of the religious (Orthodox) and political (pro-Russian) type
perished in the world war, the Greek-Catholic clergy sought a new
national and political identity. Radicalism seemed at first to prevent
the kind of cooperation between clerical and lay populist
intelligentsia in "organic work" among the people that had occurred
                           196

in the 1870s and 1880 g . The gulf between priests and populists had
grown great. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and Bishops Chekhovych and
Khomyshyn criticised Radicalism in a pastoral letter of 1907 on the
parliamentary elections. 645 The pages of the clerical journal Nyva,
founded in 1904 and supported by Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, are full
of attacks on Radicalism. 646 After the assassination of the Viceroy
Potocki Metropolitan Sheptytskyi condemned the act in a sermon;
and in a joint pastoral letter addressed to the faithful, the Galician
bishops warned of the dangers of politics without God, declaring that
a crime in the name of patriotism was particularly evil because
people might be tempted to praise jt.647 Populist, if not popular,
opinion roundly criticised the Metropolitan for his condemnation.
       Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi ignored the hostility of the populists
and supported various national causes. In 1901 he had implicitly
approved of the Ruthenian student strike and had helped the
students pursue their studies abroad. In 1910 he spoke out in the
House of Lords in Vienna in support of a Ukrainian university. In
1913-1914 he was instrumental in the electoral reform that would
have given the Ruthenians political power commensurate with their
numbers. He had blessed the blue and yellow colours of the "Sich
Sharpshooters," a Ukrainian formation in the Austrian army, in
1914. A prisoner of Tsarist Russia, he returned in 1917 to speak out in
the following year against clerical Russophilism and in support of
the Ukrainian orientation. He supported the peace of Brest-Litovsk,
in which the Central Powers recognised the Ukrainian People's
Republic, in Parliament on 28 February 1918. In the succeeding
years, he travelled extensively to gain support for the Ukrainian
state. Upon returning to Poland in 1923 he was interned in Poznaxi by
the government authorities until he agreed to issue a pastoral letter
calling for obedience to the Polish authorities in Galicia.648

648 Different versions of the circumstances and reasons for the arrest have
been advanced. This version is given by Andrzej Ziçba, citing Papierzyi{ska-
Turek, who had access to the minutes of sessions of the Political Committee of
                            197

Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi was loyal to the Western Ukrainian
dictator Evhen Petrushevych. 649 For the Greek-Catholic clergy,
Sheptyts'kyi legitimised first the Ruthenian populist, and then the
Ukrainian nationalist cause.
       The Greek-Catholic priest, however, was no stranger to
politics. 650 Since the mid-nineteenth century various members of the
clergy had held seats in the Galician diet and the parliament in
Vienna, some for long spans of years. Many of these had been Old
Ruthenians.65'
       True, with the gradual secularisation of Ruthenian Galician
politics, clerical representation in the elected bodies was diminished.
Nevertheless, with the establishment of the Western Ukrainian
Popular Republic in October 1918, many Greek-Catholic priests were
given the opportunity to participate directly in the experience of
nation-building. Some held important political posts or worked in the
local administration. 652 Others served as chaplains in the Ukrainian
Galician Army in the campaigns against the Poles in 19181919.653

campaigns. 654 Those who were stationed in eastern Ukraine had an
opportunity to acquaint themselves with the people with which
Ruthenian populists had identified since 1848. The encounter with
an awakening Ukraine, distinct from the Russia adulated by the Old
Ruthenians, fortified the younger clerics' notion of a united
Ukrainian state. 655 In 1919-1921, many priests were arrested or
interned as the Polish authorities took control of Galicia. 656 These
experiences must have played an important part in the formation of
the clergy's political outlook.
       Political activism was by no means unique to the Greek-
Catholic clergy. The activist Polish priest was a familiar figure in
nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Poland, particularly in the
Prussian partition. 657 In Galicia, Fr. Józef Panas (1887-1940,
ordained 1911), later known as a political figure, took part as a
military chaplain in the battles for Peremyshi' and L'viv. 658 Abroad,
too, members of the clergy were prominent in politics; in 1922 Fr.
Ignaz Seipel became Chancellor of Austria.
       The events of the world war and the Ukrainian war of
liberation prompted the Greek-Catholic priest to define his political
position. As Ruthenian populism developed into Ukrainian
nationalism, it became a more palatable alternative to Russophilism.
At the same time Radicalism, like Russophilism, was to some extent
a casualty of wartime opportunities. Russia was taken over by a left-
wing socialist party. The Western Ukrainian Popular Republic found

itself pitted against Bolsheviks as well as Poles (although a portion of
the Ukrainian Galician Army eventually did join the Red Army after
being driven out of Galicia by Hailer's troops). After the collapse of
Petliura's and Pilsudski's joint eastern offensive, for two and a half
months in the summer of 1920, sixteen districts around Ternopil'
constituted a Galician Soviet Socialist Republic. On 1 August 1920,
the Galician Revolutionary Committee (Halrevkom) declared
separation of Church from state and school. 659 Suddenly, radical left
socialism was a concrete and not altogether pleasant reality.
Although in the 1920s, Ukrainianisation in the Ukrainian SSR made
Bolshevism attractive to some Galician Ukrainians, the liquidation
of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine in 1928 and the
destruction of independent Ukrainian life by Stalin's regime after
1929 tended to discredit left-wing socialism in the eyes of many. As
the Galician Ukrainian political spectrum moved to the right
towards the end of the 1920s, it became easier for the traditionally
conservative Greek-Catholic clergy to find its place in it. In 1925 the
Labour Party regrouped with moderate populists as the Ukrainian
National Democratic Union (UNDO). Around 1928, "Prosvita"
purged its leftist elements. Having long sympathised with
Ruthenian and Ukrainian populism, the clergy could again join
hands with the populists with a clear conscience. As before the war,
a number of priests were politically active. It has even been asserted
that it was the influence of the priests that assured UNDO's
dominance in Ukrainian Galician politics.660
        Of course, not all Greek-Catholic priests supported UNDO. The
surviving Old Ruthenians continued to oppose the "Ukrainians" and
maintained total loyalty to Poland. Fr. Mykola fl'kiv of the Ukrainian

period. Fr. Iuliian Tatomyr (1883-1946, ordained 1908) was elected to the Senate
on the UNDO slate in 1928. An assistant priest and catechist in Sambir, he had
worked in "Prosvita" and other social organisations. In 1918 he had organised
the peasantry and "took Sambir from the Poles. Later he served in various
parishes, continuing his social and cultural work. He was imprisoned several

Peasant Party announced a normalisation with the Polish
government in 1923.661 Other priests supported a conservative
platform, some following the ideas of Viacheslav Lypyns'kyi
(Wadaw Lipiiski). 662 However, the Galician bishops set an example
in supporting the boycott of the 1922 Polish elections, at a time when
the Polish occupation of Galicia had not been ratified by the League
of Nations, and by protesting against the Council of Ambassadors'
decision of 14 March 1923 awarding Eastern Galicia to Poland.663
The rank and file clergy often defied or circumvented the
requirement, specified in the 1925 Concordat, of reciting a liturgical
prayer for the prosperity of the Republic of Poland and of its
President each Sunday and on the Third of May.664

requisite prayer, in Latin, was agreed upon by a conference of bishops in
Warsaw in May of 1925. Appropriate decrees were issued by Bishop Khomyshyn
of Stanyslaviv on 4 March 1926 and by Archbishop-Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi of
L'viv on 15 March 1926. In April 1926, the L'viv district starosta provided the
county authorities with a list of 37 parishes in which Greek-Catholic priests
failed to fully and properly recite the prayer; one priest, according to a
confidential report, said a prayer for Ukraine instead. In June 1926 the L'viv
governor reported to the Ministry of Religious Cults that the majority of the
Ruthenian clergy in Lviv county were not reciting the required prayer. Some
did recite it, but others claimed that they had not received instructions from their
ordinariat. Some priests recited the prayer in a general or ambiguous way, not
clearly naming the Polish state. In August 1927, the department of public security
of the L'viv county government reported to the Ministry of Religious Cults that
most of the Greek-Catholic clergy failed to observe Article VIII of the Concordat.
In the same year, the department of public security of the Cracow county
government reported to the Ministry of Religious Cults that a part of the Greek-
Catholic clergy in the Nowy S4cz and Gorlice districts had failed to celebrate the
Third of May. In the Nowy Sacz district only three priests had held the requisite
service, while ten had desisted; in the Gorlice district, four priests had failed to
hold the service, while two had celebrated only an ordinary liturgy. In two other
districts, however, the clergy had observed the national holiday. In the same
year, nearly 18% of the Greek-Catholic clergy of Stanyslaviv county failed to
celebrate the Third of May. Thirty had failed to do so in Ternopil' county. This
was still a problem in 1930; in 1938, the L'viv county government informed the
Ministry of Cults that the Ruthenian priests mostly did not carry out
satisfactorily the requirements of Article VIII. AAN, MWR i OP file 929, pp. 36,

       In the Lemko Apostolic Administration formed in 1934, partly
to cut the area off from Ukrainian agitation by Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi's
nationalist priests, the government kept a close eye on political
developments and apparently pressured the administrator to do
likewise. In 1937, the Administration forbade its clergy to receive the
"chauvinistic Ukrainian" newspapers "Nash Lemko" and
"Ukrains'kyi Beskyd." Forty-seven priests were fined for defying the
order. Some continued nevertheless to obtain the newspapers
through third parties, and to disseminate them among the
Lemkos.665
       With the growing nationalist mood of the clergy, a certain
amount of peer pressure could be exerted upon the less patriotic. In
1929 Fr. Vasyl' Prykhidko of the L'viv archeparchy, whose village
had received state aid after a fire, attended a reception in honour of
the Ternopil' governor. Not long after he was expelled from a
gathering on the feast day of a nearby Greek-Catholic parish. His
dean, Fr. Pellikh, circulated a letter throughout the deanery
explaining that the priest hosting the feast-day celebration had
withdrawn his invitation to Fr. Prykhidko because of the latter's
"acts inconsistent with the honour of a Ukrainian priest and former
officer of the Ukrainian army." Dean Pellikh added that all the
clergy "are called and obligated to a decisive struggle against base
slavishness and vileness among the clergy."666 Parishioners, too,
could exert political pressure on their priest.667
       The adoption of the Ukrainian nationalist platform presented
problems of another kind. As will be discussed below, it was
necessary to come to terms with the secular culture of greater
Ukraine. Like the Ruthenian populists of the nineteenth century
before them, the Ukrainian nationalists of the inter-war period had

666      In a letter of 29 January 1930 a Polish official, probably Ambassador
Skrzynski at the Polish Embassy to the Holy See, sent this information to an

illustrate "the state of mind of a large part of the Ruthenian Catholic clergy and

 developed an heroic view of Ukrainian history which did not fit
 neatly into the Greek-Catholic clerical world view. Before World War
 One, the Radicals had named their youth organisation "Sich," after
 the Zaporozhian Cossack headquarters, and in 1914 the Galician
 Ukrainian legions took the name "Sich Sharpshooters." Now the
 nationalists developed these historical motifs into an elaborate
 mythology. In glorifring Cossack resistance to Polish domination in
 the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the nationalists
 also exalted Orthodox resistance to Catholicism and the Union. In
 idealising the periods of Ukrainian state-building, principally the
 creation of a Cossack commonwealth by Bohdan Khmel'nyts'kyi,
 they also praised the idea of an autocephalous Ukrainian Church
 independent of both Rome and Moscow. Before the first world war, a
 seminarian from L'viv travelling to eastern Ukraine could remark
 on the sorry state of Orthodoxy, reduced as it was to a state
 religion. 668 Catholicism was the only available Ukrainian alternative
 to what was commonly called tsareslaviia. In the 1920s, however, a
Ukrainian national Church became a reality on the other side of the
 Soviet border. Greek-Catholic clerics were aware of lay sympathies
for the idea of an "autocephalous" Ukrainian Church, free of Polish
intrigues in the higher spheres of Roman Catholic church
politics. 669 Furthermore, the Catholic Church was a supra-national
organisation at odds with nationalist movements in countries like
France or Italy. Thus the anti-clerical strain in populism,
exemplified by the Radicals' hostility towards the "Black
International," continued in Ukrainian nationalism.
        There was another problem. Ukrainian nationalism implied a
joining of the entire Ukrainian population, which was
overwhelmingly Orthodox, into a single state. The Greek-Catholic
clergy who joined the nationalist camp would thus have to develop
some sort of coherent attitude to their Orthodox brothers.

fashionable country and was beginning to set the tone for countries and entire

Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi offered an answer by reviving the vision of
his seventeenth-century predecessor losyf Veliamyn Ruts'kyi, who
had attempted a true Union of the Uniate and Orthodox Churches in
a Kievan Patriarchate. 670 The 300th anniversary of Ruts'kyi's death
was elaborately commemorated in 1937. 671 Sheptyts'kyi himself was
an organiser of the Union congresses in Velehrad, and his clergy
participated in similar meetings in Piiisk. The 300th anniversary of
the death of St. Josaphat, now regarded as a Ukrainian martyr for
Church unity, was observed in 1923. However, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi was isolated by the very breadth of his Uniate vision,
which extended culturally beyond Ukraine and ecclesiologically
beyond the simple notion of converting the Orthodox. On the one
hand, it would not be until the Second Vatican Council that such a
liberal attitude towards the Orthodox would become widely accepted
in the Catholic Church. On the other hand, the idea of Union,
particularly a Union extending beyond Ukraine and throughout
Orthodox Russia, was somewhat beyond the immediate concerns of
the average Galician parish priest.
       The potential conflict between the clergy and the extreme
nationalists was sharpened in the general radicalisation of politics
in the inter-war period. 672 Veterans of the Ukrainian war of
liberation had founded the underground Ukrainian Military
Organisation (UVO) in the early 1920s. The UVO carried out acts of
sabotage against the Polish regime, and was evidently financed from
abroad. In January 1929, the UVO was broadened into the
Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) at a meeting in
Vienna. Fed by the young, disaffected, and often unemployed village
youth that streamed into the small towns of Galicia during the 1930s,
the OUN developed an ideology inspired by the charismatic Eastern
670 See fn.CjOin the preceding section and the accompanying text.
671 On 14 December 1936, Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi issued a pastoral letter on
this occasion, stressing that the Union had preserved the people's natsional'nist'.
It had saved the people's Catholic faith, their Eastern rite, and their love of their
nation. He further stated that the Union faced the same tasks in the present.

672 According to a Polish account of 1938, the Ukrainian village was similar
to the Polish village except that it was sometimes poorer and was greatly
radicalised in both the communist and the nationalist direction. The author
noted that Ukrainian nationalism arose out of the instinct for self-preservation,
whereas communism was a product of peasant poverty. "Czarno na Bia,'m" no.

Ukraini)i Dmytro Dontsov. Having provoked the pacification of 1930
(a disproportionate response to crop-burning on Polish estates), its
members retaliated with acts of terror that escalated with each
excessive reaction of the Polish authorities. Polish political activist
Tadeusz Hoówko was assassinated in 1931, Interior Minister
Bronistaw Pieracki in 1934. 673 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi condemned
the latter act (as well as the harsh policy of the authorities) in a
pastoral letter of 4 August 1934. In the same year he denounced the
murder of the Ukrainian school director Ivan Babii, who had blocked
OUN recruitment among his pupils. The integral nationalist
ideology of the OUN was simply incompatible with Christian
teaching. 674 Similar conflicts were taking place in Germany and
Italy. Although the Lateran accords of 1929 and the German
Concordat of 1933 gave hope of an accord between fascist nationalism
and the Church, Pope Pius Xl's encyclical "Mit brennender Sorge"
of March 1937 criticised German National Socialism, and a series of
verbal conflicts and violent incidents in Germany and Italy
illustrated the irreconcilability of Catholicism and integral
nationalism. 675 In Galicia, the Church was once again at odds with
a significant portion of the national movement.
       How the clash of values inherent in this conflict affected the
clergy's moral leadership of Ukrainian society will be discussed in
Chapter Eight. The ideological conflict, however, was of interest to
only some of the parish clergy. 676 One could condemn terrorism and
673 Prus 130.
674 See Chapter 8, Section 2. This problem existed in Polish religious and
political life as well during this period. The relationship between Catholicism
and "totalism" in Poland is explored by Bogumil Grott in "The Conception of

676 At their deanery meetings of June 1939, the clergy of the Turka deanery
discussed the inclusion of patriotic themes in sermons. Nearly all those of the
Bircha deanery discussed a talk by Fr. Savka about "Ideological Directions of
Contemporary Europe." According to the minutes of the latter meeting, the
gathered priests felt that manifestations of Ukrainian nationalism were
moderate reactions to various kinds of provocation. In his talk, Fr. Savka had
discussed socialism, communism, national socialism and fascism in
considerable detail, criticising them all. In particular he criticised the
                             205

the secular ideologies that justified it, yet sympathise with the
Ukrainian nationalist movement in general terms. This, in fact,
appears to have been the position of the majority of the Ukrainian
Greek-Catholic clergy in the 1930s.
       The accord reached between UNDO and the Polish
government in 1935 resulted in a few years of relative peace in
Galicia. However, the creation of an autonomous Carpatho-
Ukrainian entity in October 1938 provided a prototype of the
Ukrainian state. Enthusiastic Galicians swarmed across the
mountains to put their nationalist dreams into practice. Among
them were priests eager to serve as chaplains in the "Carpathian
Sich."677 It was of no small importance to the Galician clergy that
the Carpatho-Ukrainian state was headed by a Greek-Catholic
priest, Rev. Avhustyn Voloshyn. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi himself
supported Carpatho-Ukraine, while Polish opinion generally
supported the Hungarian troops that crushed it in March 1939.678 In
villages throughout Galicia, Greek-Catholic priests gave rousing
patriotic sermons and celebrated masses for the intention of the
fledgling state, and after the March debacle commemorated its
victims.679
       In the 1930s, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi avoided direct
participation in politics, intervening only when, as in the case of the
pacification of 1930 680 or the nationalists' terror campaign of the
following years, a moral issue required comment. He favoured the
idea of Catholic organisations -- as opposed to political parties -- that
would influence politics without taking part in political campaigns.

After the pacification of 1930, the Metropolitan sought to repair the
devastation of Ukrainian community life by proposing in October
1930 an apolitical organisation to be known as the Ukrainian
Catholic Alliance. 681 Created in 1931, the Alliance published the
newspaper "Meta." Its activity was generally confined to the L'viv
archeparchy. In 1936 the metropolitan issued a pastoral letter which
in its condemnation of communism anticipated Pope Pius XIs
encyclical "Divini Redemptoris" of the following year. 682 He did
maintain friendly relations with nationalist leaders, and was
attacked in the Sejm by B. Wojciechowski on 15 February 1938 for his
allegedly anti-Polish activities. 683 Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi of Peremyshl',
considered in Polish quarters to be a Ukrainian nationalist, quietly
fostered a nationally conscious Ukrainian clergy.
       In the Stanyslaviv eparchy, a somewhat different situation
arose. In 1925, a Ukrainian Christian Organisation was formed in
L'viv, but mainly served the Stanyslaviv eparchy under Bishop
Khomyshyn's direction. 684 In 1926, Bishop Khomyshyn formed the
Ukrainian Catholic Popular Party. Inspired to a great extent by the
talented journalist Osyp Nazaruk, who also edited "Nova Zoria," the
organisation advocated legality and cooperation with the Polish
authorities. Together with the "Skala" reading-rooms (see Chapter
Five), the Party represented Bishop Khomyshyn's attempt to build a
truly Catholic Ukrainian political, social and cultural edifice that
would provide an alternative to atheistic Communism and anti-
Christian nationalism. Already at odds with the secular
intelligentsia over their alleged Radical tendencies, the Bishop took
on the Ukrainian nationalists, elaborating his ideas in pastoral
letters 685 and in a book published in 1933.686 In February 1939 he

publicly criticised the Ukrainian national independence movement
as a threat to the Church, pointing out that the Ukrainian Popular
Republic of 1917-1921 had been governed by anti-clerical
intellectuals.687
       Some parish priests outside the Stanyslaviv eparchy, too,
shared Bishop Khomyshyn's perspective. Few if any joined the OUN,
though Fr. Isydor Nahaievs'kyi was among the suspected Ukrainian
nationalists confined at the Bereza Kartuska concentration camp set
up in 1934. Apparently, most of the Greek-Catholic clergy of the
1930s sympathised with UNDO, which continued to pursue a
moderate nationalist line combining civic loyalty to the Polish state
with the ultimate goal of Ukrainian independence. In many
Galician villages, the priest faced an increasingly excited nationalist
mood among the parishioners, OUN recruitment among the youth
and some Communist agitation on the fringes of society. Typically,
his own attitude could be described as a fervent but politically
undefined Ukrainian nationalism in full harmony with his religious
convictions and his priestly role.
       In 1916 Fr. Iuliian Dzerovych, writing in Nyva about the
clergy's wartime experiences, made the following prediction:
              We therefore believe that the ancient, glorious
           tradition of the past, which inseparably joined
           our clergy with our people, will be resurrected.
           The strength and significance of the clergy will
           undoubtedly increase after the war, for now it
           has become apparent what individuals full of
           dedication, full of heroism it was provided with.
              We believe that our Catholic faith, which
           showed so much inconsummable faith in those
           days, which gave protection to persecuted
           Ukrainianism, will become our national
           treasure, disputed by none, that it will become a
           national religion acknowledged by all.688

               At the moment when the present Metropolitan
           of Halych became the Bishop of Stanyslaviv, our
           Greek-Catholic Church in Galicia presented a
           curious ideological physiognomy. Distanced from
           the East, it did all it could to renounce Eastern
           church traditions, gladly accepting from the
           Latin Church -- even in matters of rite and
           discipline -- all that could bring it closer to the
           Latin West, of course in the mistaken conviction
           that only that which was Latin could be truly
           Catholic. It had totally lost its understanding of
           its great mission in the Universal Church, it was
           simply unaware of that special role which history
           had assigned to it -- to be a vital propagator of the
           idea of Union in the ecclesiastical East. Boarded
           up in its Galician ghetto and guaranteed the
           protection of the Austrian monarchy, it was far
           from that active life, both internal and external,
           with which it once had been expected to fulfill the
           hopes of Pope Urban VIII.

1. Bvzantinists and Westernisers

Although the 1891 L'viv Provincial Synod settled much of the ritual
controversy of the preceding decades, the broader controversy over
church culture continued right up to 1939 (and, in fact, beyond). With
the waning of Russophilism and the gradual adoption by the Greek-
Catholic clergy of a "Ukrainian Catholic" national, religious and
political identity, the focus of the debate shifted from narrow ritual
disputes to the deeper question of the Church's cultural identity, and
in particular the cultural identity of the clergy. To say that this
identity could only be Ukrainian begs the question, for it was not
altogether clear what Ukrainian cultural identity should mean for
Galicians, and specifically for Galician priests. Between 1900 and
1939, two prime cultural orientations developed within the Greek-
Catholic Church. Insofar as the parish clergy were concerned with
such questions, they remained divided between these orientations,
though not in equal portions.
        The leaders of the Greek-Catholic Church were conscious of
their position on the border between the Eastern and Western
European cultural spheres 691 This consciousness was transmitted
to the rank-and-file clergy in the seminary and beyond. 692 The
consciousness that their position was unique reinforced the
conviction of some Greek-Catholic priests that they had been chosen
to fulfill a special historical mission.693
        As discussed above (Chapter Six, Section 1), the Old Ruthenian
clergy sought their cultural identity in a Russian orientation. This


691     In 1906 "Brat Virnyi" wrote of the Ruthenian-Catholic Church's
"providential role," poised as it was "on the border of two world Christian
cultures," of harmonising these two cultures in the name of one holy, Catholic
and apostolic Church. Brat Virnyi.        j ruskyi klyr? L'viv, 1906.
692 Speaking at the official inauguration of the L'viv Theological Academy
on 6 October 1929, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi referred to "the situation of our land
and our Church on the borderland of the western and eastern worlds." "This
situation," he continued, "imposes on us the role of a mediator between East and
West." These two cultures were united "in our land, in our institutions and in
our souls." Quoted in Marusyn, Myroslav. "Pohliad na vykhovannia
kandydativ dukhovnoho stanu na Ukraini," Bohosloviia 49-50. The Metropolitan
also called for a re-evaluation of the Union, asking whether it should not be
pursued on an altogether different basis in the future. Hreko-katolvts'ka

primarily took the form of a movement to purge the Greek-Catholic
rite of latinisms and to restore East Slavic traits in ritual. As the
Russophile tendencies of the Old Ruthenians waned, the impulse to
preserve the Byzantine rite nevertheless persisted, and gradually
passed into the hands of the Byzantinists.
       One of the two principal cultural movements among the
Greek-Catholic clergy in the twentieth century, the Byzantine
tendency combined with a clearly Ukrainian national political and
cultural orientation. No longer looking to Russia for a model, the
Byzantinists sought to revive Ukrainian ecclesiastical traditions. To
some, however, Byzantinism was as objectionable as had been
Russophilism, and for similar reasons. This was the view of Polish
clerics who tended to equate the Latin rite with Catholicism and the
Byzantine rite with the Orthodox schism. Thus, in 1926 Rev.
Mieczystaw Tarnawski, who was hardly hostile to the Greek-
Catholics, counted Byzantinism among the three principal enemies
of the Uniate Church. Whereas he felt that the Greek-Catholic clergy
were well aware of the "external" dangers of Protestantism and
Ukrainian Orthodox autocephaly, he found them insufficiently
conscious of the "internal" danger of Byzantinism. 694 Among the
manifestations of the movement for purification of the Greek-
Catholic rite was the attempt to prepare new editions of service books
(trebnyky), missals, prayer books, and other liturgical books in accord
with Byzantine tradition. This project appears to have passed
smoothly from the hands of the Old Ruthenians into those of the
Ukrainian Byzantinists. The conflicts arose, rather, between the
Byzantinists and the Westernisers. Successive liturgical
commissions had only limited success. The Bishops of Peremyshi'
and Stanyslaviv could not come to an agreement with the L'viv
Archeparchy in this matter, and finally in 1938, a Vatican
commission under Cardinal Tisserant took over the project. It was
successful, following the moderate Byzantinist line of Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi, and produced a series of new editions, though not until
the 1940s and 1950s.695

       In competition with the Byzantinists, the Westernisers were
led by Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn, whose opinions on priestly
celibacy and politics have already been mentioned. Educated at
Vienna, Bishop Khomyshyn sought to introduce Latin- rite
pastoral methods, customs and to some extent discipline and
spirituality into the Greek-Catholic Church. However, he felt that
such "importations" from the Latin rite must be fully assimilated by
the Church, and even "Ukrainianised." In his 1931 pastoral letter on
Byzantinism, he asserted that this had in fact already occurred with
many Latin practices.696
       Bishop Khomyshyn had introduced a number of westernising
changes in his eparchy on 15 February 1916, in the wake of the first
Russian occupation of Galicia (and while Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi
was in exile in Russia). In his pastoral letter of that date "On the
Mission of the Ukrainian People in the Catholic Church," he had
ordered that the word "pravoslavn y i" should be replaced in the
liturgy with the word "pravovirnvi." a neologism denoting the
original sense of "right-worshipping" Christians and which could
not be misunderstood (as the former word apparently often was) to
refer to the schismatics. He had also ordered, among other things,
that the word "tsar," which could be mistakenly understood to refer
to the Russian Tsar, should be replaced with "imperator" in prayers,
that prayers for the Pope of Rome should be added, that the
Gregorian calendar should be introduced on 25 March, and that the
cult of the Eucharist should be observed. Not all the changes
mandated by this letter were westernisations; thus, it ordered
celebration of the day of St. Josaphat, principal martyr for the
Union. 697 After Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi returned from exile in

1917, the change of calendar was withdrawn, and the Julian
calendar remained in force.698
       Bishop losafat Kotsylovs'kyi of Peremyshi' took a more
radically Ukrainian political line than Bishop Khomyshyn. He also
shared Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's enthusiasm for the Union, and
his choice of the name of the great martyr for church unity as his
monastic appellation seems to have been significant in this regard.
Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi favoured a Union that, unlike the Union of
Brest, would begin with the peasants and workers and work up
through society to the bishops, rather than the other way round.699
However, he also favoured the introduction of certain Western
customs in the Greek-Catholic Church. Like his fellow hierarch in
Stanyslaviv, he sought to remove the term "pravoslavnvi" from the
liturgy and replace it with "pravovirnvi." 70 ° Bishop Khomyshyn
reasoned that the new phrase would remove the confusion of many
believers as to whether they were Catholic or Orthodox, and would
prevent further conversions to the Orthodox church. However, the
notoriously conservative Lemkos in the western part of the
Peremyshi' eparchy were scandalised by such an innovation. By
some accounts, this only aided the proponents of Orthodoxy, who
warned that the change was a harbinger of latinisation and
conversion to the Latin rite. In fact, in 1927-1928 schism did break out
in Tyliava, Koroleva Rus'ka and elsewhere in the Lemko region.70'

701 At the Mushyna deanery meeting of 31 May 1927, Dean Volodymyr
Mokhnats'kyi led a discussion of the apostasy of Koroleva Rus'ka, in which he
cited various factors but did emphasise the importance to the Lemkos of the word
"pravoslavnyi" in the liturgy. Rev. R. Pryslops'kyi favoured reinstating this
                           214

By one account, the elimination of the word "pravoslavnvkh" was the
first hint to some Lemko villagers that they were not in fact Orthodox,
but Uniates. Apparently, in their minds the Union had been imposed
on them without their knowledge or consent, and only some two
centuries later was the fact revealed. In some cases, this precipitated
transfers to Orthodoxy.702
        The Lemko case has been used to argue that the use of the
word "pravoslavnyi" stimulated apostasy -- on the ground that
conversions to Orthodoxy took place before the word's abolition -- as
well as that use of this word could have prevented it -- on the ground
that conversions took place after its abolition. In fact, neither theory
is convincing. However, this controversy illustrates the significance
attached to questions of ritual and terminology by the Greek-Catholic
clergy.
        Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's version of Byzantinism was not a
wholesale rejection of western forms. In a joint pastoral letter of 6
(19) April 1909 addressed to the clergy of the three eparchies, he and
Bishops Khomyshyn and Chekhovych recalled that when in June
1899 the Pope and all Catholic bishops had dedicated the world to the
Sacred Heart of Jesus, some Greek-Catholic priests had objected to
this as an alien form of piety. The bishops stressed that this was a
matter that went beyond rite, devotion to the Sacred Heart being
common to all rites rather than the monopoly of one. They also noted
that the people must be taught to look beyond rite to matters of faith
and morals, so that they might distinguish between Byzantine-rite
Catholicism and Byzantine-rite Orthodoxy. The letter ordered the
parish clergy to hold the appropriate solemn ceremony on the first
Sunday after the 11th of June, having explained the significance of
the cult of the Sacred Heart to their parishioners on the previous

word in the liturgy, while Rev. Ivan Kachmar, parish priest at Zlots'ke,
suggested reintroducing it only where absolutely necessary to avoid a greater
evil. Rev. Kachmar's proposition was approved unanimously. WAP-P, ABGK

Sunday. 703 Furthermore, by the late 1930s Latin-style devotions had
become popular in Galicia. Among them were the Way of the Cross,
devotions to the Virgin Mary on the first Friday of the month and in
May, and the use of rosaries. The feast day of Christ the King was
also introduced into the Greek-Catholic Church. 704 Bishop
Khomyshyn asserted in 1931 that the rosary was generally practiced
by both priests and faithful, and that use of scapulars had been
accepted.705
       At the same time, their acceptance of a Ukrainian national
identity placed the Greek-Catholic parish clergy in the awkward
positon of being the beneficiaries of an Eastern cultural heritage
closely bound up with a distinctly Orthodox and indeed anti-Uniate
religious orientation. The works of Taras Shevchenko, the founder
and chief exponent of the Ukrainian national revival of the
nineteenth century, contained passages highly critical of the Catholic
Church and the Union. If the Greek-Catholic parish clergy were to
continue to take part in nation-building, they had to somehow come to
terms with this part of the Ukrainian heritage. They would have to
purge it of its anti-Uniate elements, explain them, or simply ignore
them. Ultimately, the Byzantine tradition had to be redefined in such
a way as to show that its anti-Uniate elements were in fact politically
motivated Muscovite accretions, while its essential elements had
been and remained consistent with Catholicism, albeit broadly
defined.
       As mentioned above, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi was able to
eliminate the phenomenon of Russophilism in part by replacing it
with a renewed ideology of Union. This acted both as a functional
equivalent of Russophilism, preserving the Eastern rite, and as a
harmonising factor between the Byzantine tradition and
Catholicism. It made it possible to assimilate the Orthodox tradition
or at least come closer to it, though of course eliminating its anti-
Uniate and anti-Roman elements. To the extent that anti-Uniatism

could be explained by political factors, such as the role of the
Muscovite and Russian Church in supporting state expansion, it
could be excised from the Eastern tradition, leaving intact those
elements more easily reconciled with Catholicism.
        The Eastern tradition also had to be purged of its Russian
national colouring. At the same time it was necessary to rediscover a
specifically Ukrainian Byzantine tradition. It had to be shown that
the Greek-Catholic Church had roots that were venerable, Byzantine,
Catholic and Ukrainian. This appears to have been done. By 1939, a
parish priest could refer to the Greek-Catholic rite as being truly
"Ukrainian-Catholic."706
        However, to achieve credibility and attractiveness to the
Orthodox, a Church bent on spreading the Union had to demonstrate
that its own Union with the Holy See had succeeded in preserving the
Byzantine rite. Obviously, a modern and truly ecumenical Uniatism
mandated Byzantinism. In his farewell editorial in Nyva in October
1929, Rev. Havryil Kostel'nyk, the prime representative of the
Byzantinist orientation, stressed that Greek-Catholics must not
alienate the Orthodox. The history and the mission of the Greek-
Catholic Church was in the East, and as long as it remained a
neutrum, half-way between East and West, it could not realise its
destiny. He also made the point that whereas in his native
Yugoslavia, where Galician emigrants had preserved the Byzantine
rite in its original form, Greek-Catholicism remained strong,
emigrants from Galicia, where the Church had been latinised, were
going over to Orthodoxy en masse. 707 Rev. Kostel'nyk realised that the
idea of a Church that was half Eastern, half Western was hardly
inspiring. Indeed, he saw that Uniatism had developed a distinct and
rather effete psychology. "The eternal sore spot of our Church is this
internal lack of specificity, lack of independence in life, this blind and
uncontrolled submission to foreign influences," he wrote in 1926 in A
New Age for our Church. The Orthodox East was too great, too

different from the West, and too vital to be attracted to a Union
dominated by "the psychology of an appendage."708
        Critics of the Byzantine orientation could argue, of course, that
rather than bring the Orthodox to the Greek-Catholic Church,
Byzantinism would draw Greek-Catholics to the Orthodox Church.
The fact that Fr. Kostel'nyk would lead the union of the Greek-
Catholic Church with the Russian Orthodox Church in 1945-1946
appears to lend credit to such a prediction. However, Fr. Kostelnyk
had spoken out clearly against Orthodox schism, and his later
actions can be explained better by the dire circumstances of both his
own life and that of his Church during and after World War II.
       The Byzantine orientation also necessitated a clarification of
the Church's attitude to contemporary Orthodoxy. Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi repeatedly showed a dignified sympathy for and an
understanding of Orthodoxy in its various aspects. A number of
Greek-Catholic priests had an opportunity to observe the Russian
Orthodox Church on visits to Ukraine before World War 1.
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi had done so himself in 1887, and during
and after his confinement in 1914-1917 was able to develop his ideas
on Union through contact with Orthodox clergy. Some Greek-
Catholic priests or seminarians found themselves in Ukraine or
Russia proper as soldiers or military chaplains in the Austrian or
Ukrainian Galician armies. The typical criticism of Russian
Orthodoxy centered on its status as a state Church, whence the
appelation tsareslavii p . At the same time, an attempt was made to
discover genuine Eastern church traditions which could be
reintroduced in the Greek-Catholic Church and which could also
serve as a guide to an eventual Union with the various Orthodox
Churches. As Rev. Iuliian Dzerovych noted in 1916, one of the lessons
of the Russian occupation had been that one could not assume that a
blind clinging to ritual in the manner of the Russophiles would
attract the Orthodox to the Greek-Catholic Church. For the Russians
who had attended Greek-Catholic services had been attracted
precisely by the customs that the Russophiles had condemned as
Latin importations, such as supplications, May devotions, and use of
bells and monstrances.709

       The possibility of Union with the Russian Orthodox was
frustrated by the Bolshevik take-over, but the inclusion of Voihynia
and the Chehn region in interwar Poland raised the question of
relations with the Orthodox of those lands. These Orthodox
themselves were faced with the issue of cultural identity, torn among
Russian, Belorussian and Ukrainian traditions and political
loyalties. However slim the chances of a Union based on common
Ukrainian traditions might have been, the neo-Union movement
pursued by the Jesuits and supported by the Polish government as
well as the Roman Catholic episcopate, centered as it was on Russian
traditions, was opposed by Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and his clergy.
The notion of converting the former Uniates of these regions to a
Muscovite-rite Catholicism was as repugnant to the Galician Greek-
Catholics as the practice of converting them to the Latin rite.
However, after the 1925 Concordat the Galician Greek-Catholic
bishops were left with no jurisdiction in these regions nor any
possibility of proselytism. They could, of course, take a bitter
satisfaction in the dismal failure of the neo-Uniate movement.
However, when the government condoned the massive vandalism of
Orthodox churches in eastern Poland in 1938, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi protested vehemently in a pastoral letter dated 2 August
of that year. It seems most likely that his objection was motivated
mainly by the realisaton that a Catholic Church implicated in such
forcible "conversion" would never gain the trust, much less the
allegiance, of the Orthodox. 710 All the same it is notable that the
Metropolitan defended the Orthodox despite their Church's
aggressive proselytising among the Greek-Catholic Lemkos.
       As far as can be ascertained, the rank-and-file Greek-Catholic
clergy shared Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi' s attitudes towards
Orthodoxy, though probably not his deeper concerns with the
question of Union. Certainly the editors of Nyva considered good
relations with the Orthodox important, and in their 1939 article on
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's forty years in the episcopate stressed that
the Holy See had called for a deeper understanding of the Orthodox
East. Furthermore, only a charitable attitude to what had once been

referred to as the "schismatics" could further the Greek-Catholic
Church's special mission in the East:
              We must regard the disunited as our own
            brothers -- with love and understanding. Where
            necessary and possible, to stand up in defence of
            the disunited Church before its enemies. Hatred,
            disrespect or disdain for all that is eastern or so-
            called "orthodox" will never smooth our road to
            the disunited and will never give us the
            possibility to fulfill our privileged historic
            mission.711

      The creation of a Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church
in Ukraine in 1918-1921 posed a special challenge in the inter-war
period. Autocephalist trends existed among patriotic Ukrainian
laymen alienated by Polish influence in Rome and by latinisation in
the Galician eparchies. To some extent, the movement for Union,
exemplified by the Velehrad and Piijsk congresses, pointed to a
theoretical resolution of the question of Greek-Catholic relations with
Orthodoxy, while promising a more independent kind of Greek
Catholicism purged of excessive Western and Latin entanglement.
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's revival of the idea of a joint Uniate-
Orthodox Patriarchate, as proposed several times in the first half of
the seventeenth century (notably by Uniate Metropolitan losyf
Veliamyn Ruts'kyi), provided a model for such a Byzantine type of
Greek Catholicism successfully incorporating the Eastern tradition
and thus making schismatic "Orthodoxy" superfluous. It was
presumably with an eye to this conception of the Union that the 300th
anniversary of the martyrdom of St. Josaphat Kuntsevych was
broadly observed in Galicia in 1923, 712 and that on the 300th
anniversary of the passing of Metropolitan Ruts'kyi a special
programme was held at the Grand Theatre of L'viv on 21 March
1937.' On 23-25 December of that year, a Union Congress was held

Xl issued the encyclical Ecciesiam Dei, on St. Josaphat. It appears that in 1939,
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi at least attempted to found a "Metropolitan Ruts'kyi
Ukrainian Catholic Institute for the Union of Churches" in L'viv. A copy of a
Polish translation of the statute of this organisation, dated 17 February 1939, is at

in L'viv, under the auspices of the Theological Scholarly Society and
again commemorating the great Kievan metropolitan.714
       The relationship with Orthodoxy was not a purely
ecciesiological issue. It had a political side. Having adopted the
Ukrainian national identity, Galician Greek-Catholics had to come to
terms with the faith of the majority of their newly rediscovered
compatriots. Some kind of accommodation with Ukrainian
Orthodoxy that would not clash with fraternal relations with the
Eastern Ukrainians had to be found. For the clergy in particular, this
was an essential element of building a firm national consciousness,
and indeed, of nation-building itself. The nation could no longer by
defined by a single religion, i.e., Greek Catholicism. It was a secular
concept. 715 The Greek-Catholic parish priest had to find a way to
reconcile his acceptance of this secular concept of his nation with his
religious views. The journal of the L'viv seminarians remarked in
1901 (in a review of a brochure on the 200th anniversary of the L'viv
eparchy's acceptance of the Union of Brest) that one could not say
that a good Ruthenian had to be a Uniate, since in the times of
Bohdan Khmel'nyts'kyi and later it was precisely the Uniates who
were considered the enemies of the people. Thus, one could hardly
regard the disunited "Little Ruthenians" in the same manner.716
       It need not be assumed that the average parish priest agonised
over these problems. By the late 1930s, the notions of the Ukrainian
nation and the Greek-Catholic -- or as it was increasingly known,
Ukrainian Catholic -- faith were in harmony in the minds of many if
not most of the Greek-Catholic clergy in Galicia. Neither Ukrainian
history nor current events suggested any necessary contradiction.
There is also evidence that the Greek-Catholic clergy's world view
had become so secularised, or at least politicised, by the late 1930s
that some priests saw nationality as more important than religious
adherence.717

                            221

       In the Stanyslaviv eparchy, however, the questions of
Orthodoxy and the Byzantine tradition were seen rather differently.
The views of Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn incidentally echoed at least
a part of Polish clerical opinion, which has been mentioned in
previous chapters. 718 To him, the Byzantine tradition was
characterised by Caesaropapism, which led to a decline of
spirituality, a dry formalism, and ultimately to atheism. Bolshevism
was "the final fruit of Byzantinism, as grafted onto Russia and taken
to its ultimate conclusion." In Galicia, the Byzantinist tendency
would lead to schism. The proof, he felt, was in the fact that Radical
elements in Galicia were advocating an "autocephalous" Ukrainian
church. Furthermore, with its tendency to close identification of
spiritual with temporal power, the Byzantine tradition would lead to
the creation of a national and a state Church. Such a Church would
become a mere political entity to the detriment of its spirituality, as
had happened with the Russian Orthodox Church. Thus, Bishop
Khomyshyn's objections to Byzantinism in the cultural sphere were
intimately connected with his objections to extreme nationalism in
the political sphere. In Bishop Khomyshyn's view, the West offered a
healthy cultural tradition to be emulated and incorporated in
Ukrainian culture. This was not to be a crude adoption of Latin
church practices, but an adaptation of them to Ukrainian church
culture. Culturally as well as politically, it was to the West that
Ukrainians must look.719
       Whether the clergy of the Stanyslaviv eparchy agreed with
their bishop's views is open to question. According to a rather hostile
account, some of the Stanyslaviv priests regarded Bishop Khomyshyn

Russophiles, but also many Ukrainian populists. Id. 14. This seems to support the

                  Quite apart from the element of humour, such epithets point to the
                  bishop's stubbornly independent line.
                         In the same year as Bishop Khomyshyn's pastoral letter on
                  Byzantinism, 1931, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi issued a letter "On
                  Ritual Matters," in which he referred again to the need for unity with
                  the Orthodox. "To unite those of the East for God and Church, we
                  must ourselves be Eastern, or become Eastern," he wrote. True, there
                  were negative aspects to the Byzantine tradition, but the same could
                  be said of the Western tradition. At the same time, Catholic
                  consciousness must be developed, and when Latin customs such as
                  devotions to the Sacred Heart worked to heighten that consciousness,
                  they should be encouraged; what was to be avoided was blind
                  adherence to everything Latin. Besides, such devotions could be given
                  an Eastern form.721
                         A full incorporation of the Byzantine tradition into the concept
                  of the Ruthenian Greek-Catholic (later Ukrainian Catholic) heritage
                  required a decisive claim to the Christian culture of Kievan Rus'.
                  Thus, the 1906 pilgrimage of clergy and faithful to Palestine, led by
                  the Metropolitan himself, was commemorated in a book referring to
                  Daniel the Pilgrim, who had travelled from Rus' to the Holy Land
                  exactly 600 years earlier. 722 In 1938, the 950th anniversary of the
                  acceptance of Christianity as the state religion of Kievan Rus' which,
                  falling short of a millennium and not having even the prominence of

of spreading the Union was diffused among at least a part of the
parish clergy. However, the controversy over Byzantinism had
become so heated that in July1928, the L'viv Metropolitan Ordinariat
appealed to the clergy of the entire province as well as to the editors of
Catholic periodicals and to the faithful to desist from the discussion
because it had divided and seriously harmed relations within the
Church. 724
      A special variant of the East-West controversy, and one that
aroused more excitement than any other issue in this sphere, was
the question of mandatory priestly celibacy. As has been noted above,
this question had sociological and political as well as moral and
theological aspects. It also provided an indicator of how "Eastern" or
"Western" the Church would become. As the Polish priest Rev.
Mieczystaw Tarnawski observed in 1926, the struggle over celibacy
was a struggle over Byzantinism.725
      The fact that Papal pronouncements on the priesthood in
general, such as the 1935 encyclical "Ad Catholici Sacerdotii," were
directed primarily toward the Latin rite and therefore
understandably emphasised the importance of priestly celibacy, lent
the proponents of compulsory celibacy an argument that was only
apparently weighty. 726 The dispute was not over the merits of priestly
celibacy -- though lay critics contested these too -- but over the
necessity of making it compulsory in the Greek-Catholic Church.
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi avoided imposing compulsory celibacy in
the L'viv archdiocese, if only because he did not believe that such a
major change in church discipline could be resolved by fiat. As he
wrote in an article on "The Psychology of Union" in 1925, the Church
had always chosen to wait for disciplinary reforms to arise of their
own accord in the reunited communities. 727 Thus, in the L'viv
archeparchy both celibates and married men continued to be

of this encyclical by the Rev. Onufrii Ors'kyi in Al'manakh ukrains'kykh
bohosloviv, Peremyshl', 1937, 17-40. Rev. Ors'kyi argues that the Eastern
tradition, too, favoured priestly celibacy, which is required by the very nature of
the priesthood. The same argument has been made recently by Cholij, Roman.

ordained throughout the inter-war period, while in Stanyslaviv and
Peremyshi' only celibates were ordained from 1920 and 1925,
respectively. In the 1920s the clergy found themselves amidst a
raging controversy on this issue, carried on in great part by the
secular press. In the 1930s, however, other matters seem to have
taken the fore.728
       A more subt]e aspect of the controversy between Byzantinists
and Westernisers was that of ritual coherence. In 1900, the Greek-
Catholic Church was a hybrid, blending Byzantine and Western
characteristics in a not altogether harmonious manner.
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi understood that ritual aesthetics were an
indicator of spiritual health. Korolevskij describes the devotional
booklets published by the Basilian fathers at Zhovkva as "un curieux
mélange de traditions ruthènes, d'orientalisme et d'hybridismes,"
remarking that Greek-Catholic adaptations of modern Latin
devotions "n'étaient pas toujours du meilleur goit." 729 From a
different perspective, Bishop Khomyshyn, too, pointed to the
confusion and scandal that resulted when, for example, a priest tried
to sing a Low Mass. 730 While a certain coherence might be attainable
by purging either all Byzantine or all Latin elements from the
Church, neither course was feasible or even desirable. How, then,
was one to harmonise the Byzantine tradition with Western
accretions? How was one to distinguish between Latin elements that
had been (or could be) successfully assimilated and those that should
be expelled? Questions of this sort primarily concerned liturgists, but
the parish priest was faced with this issue in a concrete, if modest
way in the various details of his liturgical pratice.73'
       Rev. A. Galandiuk, writing in Nyva in 1918, expressed a
moderate view probably in keeping with the thinking of Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi when he stated that the rite had to be modernised, but
728      Some priests did speak out publicly, among them Rev. Myron Korytko,
parish priest at Kholoiv, in a colourfully entitled brochure. Korytko, Myron.

evidently a half-baked attempt to 'byzantinise" the liturgy. Pastvrs'kyi Ij
Hrvhoriia Khomvshvna. Stanyslaviv, 1931, p. 24.
731      Related to the question of ritual aesthetics was the matter of ecclesiastical
art, discussed briefly in the following section.
                          225

without forcible additions of foreign elements, if only to avoid
aesthetic discord. Just as in art and literature, the blind imitation of
foreign works must be avoided, so in ritual matters, it could only
result in "a monstrosity and a parody." Furthermore, such
innovations would offend the faithful, with their instinctive sense of
harmony and beauty. Rev. Galandiuk in fact favoured certain
reforms such as introduction of the Gregorian calendar and of the
Ukrainian language in services (in place of Church Slavonic).
However, he emphasised that all changes must be made gradually
and incorporated fully into the existing rite.732
      What role did Byzantinism play in the life of the Greek-
Catholic clergy? Henryk Ignacy Lubieñski, a perceptive critic of the
Byzantine orientation, wrote in 1934 that whereas before the war, the
conservative current in the Greek-Catholic Church had overlapped
with Russophilism, afterwards Ukrainian nationalism had taken
over the Russophile programme. 733 However discredited the
Russophile orientation may have been, in the nineteenth century it
had served as a guarantor of Ruthenian ecclesiastical identity in the
face of polonisation and latinisation. The same function became even
more important with the inclusion of Galicia in a Polish state with a
privileged Latin-rite clergy. Byzantinism guaranteed the Greek-
Catholic clergy's cultural survival, and it did so in harmony with the
growing current of Ukrainian nationalism.
      Byzantinism appears to have had a social base similar to that
of Russophilism. At first this may seem unlikely, since the
Russophiles were in great part members of priestly clans (see
Chapter Four), whereas the Byzantinist clergy of the 1920s and 1930s
were sons of farmers or townsmen. However, many if not most
Russophiles were laymen, and members of the rising intelligentsia.
With the advent of a new breed of clerics after World War I, and the
simultaneous rise of a village intelligentsia, much of which
streamed into towns and cities, the social base of Byzantinism was
formed. Like the Russophiles, the Byzantinists comprised both the lay
and the clerical elite. Byzantinism, whether or not accepted by the

masses, did not originate with them. It is symptomatic that lay
Byzantinists ridiculed their chief clerical opponent, Bishop
Khomyshyn, in part by referring to his peasant origins.734
Byzantinism was a phenomenon of the elite, which in great part it
had received from the hands of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and which
only gradually penetrated the mass of parish priests and believers.
In the Stanyslaviv eparchy it had little success, of course, and in
Peremyshi' it was not altogether supported by the church
authorities. 735 It appears that in the L'viv eparchy, though there was
not enough time for the ideas of Fr. Hryhorii Kostel'nyk and his
supporters to transform the ritual practices of the clergy as a whole,
Byzantinism scored its greatest victories.
        Did the Greek-Catholic clergy develop a clear cultural
orientation between 1900 and 1939? In August of 1939 the editors of
Nyva wrote that in his forty years as a bishop Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi had made clear to all the great role that his Church was
to play within the Universal Church as "a synthesis of the
Ecclesiastical East and West." "He has led our Church," they
continued, "out from its narrow Galician provincialism into the
broad world arena, first with his own person and his own efforts or
initiative, and later through the creative work of its clergy, or with
the particularity of its liturgical-ritual life in the Catholic
Church."736
       The special role of the Greek-Catholic Church (as the Second
Vatican Council was to recognise twenty-five years later) was to be its
work in re-uniting the East with the Church of Rome:
             And there began a renaissance of our church
           and religious thought; the essence of the Union,
           about which almost everyone had forgotten, and
           some cannot even remember it even today --

from the eparchial authorities in Peremyshl' when he sought to publish his
Homiletical Lessons, in which he extolled, for example, the social and cultural
role of the priest's wife, exclaiming that "we stand and fall with a married
clergy!" WAP-P, ABGK file 4786.

           all. And this essence is such: the Union is the
           unification in faith of two branches of the
           Universal Church, the eastern and the western,
           under the leadership of the Vicar of Christ -- the
           Pope of Rome.737

     According to the editors of Nyva, this new consciousness of the
Greek-Catholic Church's missionary role had brought with it a
change in the consciousness of its clergy:
              Gradually, perhaps even too slowly, the type of
           Ukrainian Catholic priest of the Byzantine-
           Slavonic rite -- who up to the present would
           equate Catholicism with Latinism, who would
           cling spastically to all those Latin ritual forms,
           which had been introduced into our Church
           only in the times of its weakness, and who
           wanted to see our Church as something in the
           middle--neither eastern nor western -- is
           disappearing. The "Uniate" type, who seemed to
           be ashamed of belonging to the eastern rite, is
           vanishing.
              Instead, individuals and entire groups are
          growing among this clergy who, in obedience to
          the Apostolic See, would like to see the ritual
          liturgical life of our Church in all its beauty and
          purity, and therefore are striving for the gradual
          removal from it of everything that was taken
          from the Latin rite, and which only serves to
          alienate the disunited from the Union. Only a
          Union that is clothed in the liturgical-ritual
          vestments and lofty traditions of the ecclesiastical
          East will survive the hardest trial and will
          become strong and lasting. Ritual hybridisms are
          a phenomenon not only undesirable for the
          Union, but harmful to the greatest degree, and
          everyone who seeks to make permanent these
          Latin incrustations is acting against the idea of
          Union, against the will of the Vicars of Christ.738
       Thus, by 1939 the Byzantinist cultural orientation, shared by at
least a good part of the clergy of the L'viv archeparchy, had become
part and parcel of a vision of the Greek-Catholic Church's mission in
spreading the Union throughout the East.

                            228


        The necessity of finding an ecclesiastical cultural orientation
was accompanied by the challenge of Ukrainian secular culture.
From its beginnings to the end of the eighteenth century, Ukrainian
high culture had been almost exclusively religious. By 1900, in
Galicia as well as in the Russian Ukraine, a secular Ukrainian high
culture had developed. Influenced by western European currents and
responding to local social conditions, this culture, at least in its
literary forms, contained anti-clerical elements. The Ukrainian
national poet, Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861), had inveighed against
Uniatism as a tool of historical Polish imperialism. The foremost
Galician Ukrainian literary figure, Ivan Franko (1856-1916), had
criticised the socio-economic role of the Greek-Catholic clergy.
Ukrainian culture not only had become secularised, but seemed, at
least in part, to be turning against the Church. If the clergy had been
the leaders of the Ruthenian cultural revival in the mid-nineteenth
century, now they found themselves among its targets.
        Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi saw the problem, which he
addressed in his 1901 pastoral letter to the Ruthenian intelligentsia.
Rather than seeking to dictate to them, he aimed for a harmonious
coexistence between the Church and the secular intelligentsia. 739 At
first this was difficult, given the anti-clerical attitude of much of the
latter. It appears that the Metropolitan sought to reconcile Ivan
Franko and his fellow writer Vasyl' Stefanyk with the Church. 740 He
provided funding for painters like Oleksa Novakivs'kyi and
commissioned church art in its various forms. The journal Dzvony,
which enjoyed his financial support, provided a forum for Catholic
writers and critics like the talented Lemko poet Bohdan Ihor
Antonych (1909-1937). Sheptyts'kyi also founded a Ukrainian national
museum in 1905 which, serving after its opening in 1913 as a
showplace for Ukrainian ecclesiastical art and antiquities, helped to
create a sense of a millennial tradition of Ukrainian spiritual

written in Vienna and dated 27 January 1901. The Metropolitan had also
addressed the intelligentsia in his first pastoral letter as Bishop of Stanyslaviv
in 1899, and mentioned the problem of the intelligentsia in his pastoral letter to
the Stanyslaviv clergy of that same day. Tvorv 14-16, 26-27.

culture. As anti-clerical currents died down in the 1920s and 1930s,
the idea of a modern Ukrainian Christian culture began to seem
feasible.
       Nevertheless, Ukrainian culture, like that of most modern
nations, had reached a secular stage. Inevitably, some of it was at
odds with Church teachings and tastes. Unlike Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi, who had grown up in a cosmopolitan milieu, Bishop
Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv was quick to characterise literature as
anti-religious or immoral. While acknowledging their talents, he
criticised both Taras Shevchenko and Ivan Franko. 74 ' The bishop
was not alone in his criticism of the latter. In 1913, in response to
widespread celebrations in honour of Franko, Nykolai Sadovs'kyi
(possibly a Basilian monk) wrote a brochure criticising a priest who
had publicly supported the celebrations in an article in the L'viv daily
"Dilo." Pointing out that Franko (then still alive) was an enemy of
Christ, Sadovs'kyi declared that he should recognise that his artistic
talent was a gift from God, and should use it to serve him. 742 At a
session of the Peremyshl' cathedral chapter on 27 May 1919, Bishop
Kotsylovs'kyi asked his canons how he should respond to the request
of the local intelligentsia for a service in memory of the poet, who had
died three years before. Several of the canons recommended asking
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's opinion. However, the young Rev. Canon
Konstantyn Bohachevs'kyi (future Metropolitan of Philadelphia) felt
that in view of Franko's scandalous writings and the circumstances
of his death, no service could be held. His opinion prevailed.743
       In 1927 "Nova Zoria," which represented Bishop Khomyshyn's
point of view, reprinted part of a pseudonymous article arguing that
although Ivan Franko had begun to return to the faith and the
Church late in life and on visits to his native village of Nahuievychi
would even read the epistle during liturgy, he had been an atheist in
his younger years, and it was this Franko -- "Saul, not Paul" -- that
was the object of the cult then current amongst the intelligentsia.744
Nevertheless, the clergy seem to have shared the secular

intelligentsia's reverence for both Shevchenko and Franko, whose
works could be found in priests' private libraries.745
       While seeking to harmonise secular culture with the
teachings of the Church, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and his followers
naturally sought to revive Ukrainian religious culture. This involved
the support, for example, of icon-painters and choirs. 746 It also
required a vision of the relationship between Ukrainian religious (not
just ecclesiastical) culture and both the East and the West. Such a
vision was formed among the clergy through various contacts with
western and eastern culture. In December 1913 Osyp Ostashevs'kyi
wrote of the L'viv seminarians' encounter with the West during the
secession of 190 1-1902:
              The relations of the secessionist seminarians
           with seminarians of other peoples, and with
           laymen of sincerely Catholic convictions, above
           all in Vienna, had a beneficial effect on the
           change of our seminarians' world view. They
           saw how our intelligentsia in general received
           western civilisation, but only that part of it that
           was far from the principles of the teachings of
           Christ; they were aware that such culture
           brings destruction and not good to our society. In
           the midst of such conditions our young
           seminarians understood that above all they
           must receive Catholic religious ideas from the
           West and colour the national and social aspect of
           our national life with them, and thus react
           against the dark forces of advancing
           faithlessness.747

       Thus, the Greek-Catholic clergy had begun to discover western
European culture for itself. No longer dependent on the secular
intelligentsia's narrow vision of this culture, which selected those
aspects congenial to its prejudices and concerns, the clergy could
develop its own view of western civilisation. It could thus seek out
Christian elements and adapt them to its own cultural vision. As
early as 1901, rulijan Dzerovych, who was to become a highly
influential priest, could confidently assert that "cool critical

intelligence, deeper learning lead to Christ; only the superficial leads
away from him" and point to the revival of Christian ideas in great
Western nations like England, France and the United States. To
Dzerovych, only "the unprogressive cling to atheism." 748 This
implied a critique of current Western European as well as Ukrainian
secular culture -- a critique that could be carried on by a Christian
secular intelligentsia as well as by the clergy. Thus, as seen in the
pages of Dzvony and reflected in the works of creative artists close to
the Church, a Ukrainian secular culture of Christian inspiration
could arise.
        A Ukrainian Christian culture, whether sacred or secular,
would inevitably reflect the orientation of the Church at least in some
degree. As seen above, this Church remained divided on the question
of East or West. The cultural confusion inherent in "Uniatism" was
mirrored in the aesthetics of church art. The pseudonymous Rev.
S.M. of B. remarked in 1916 that some new Greek-Catholic churches
were "monstrosities without taste, style or beauty." Well-intentioned
but misguided parish priests were importing church art from
Bavaria or the Tyrol. This repelled the faithful, and in any case did
not inspire piety or love. If the priests had been better educated, he
continued, they would know their own Church and would not be
replacing beautiful traditional songs with all sorts of German and
Italian themes, which were often secular and would "turn our
churches into concert halls." If these priests were better acquainted
with their own history and traditions, they would not need to pack
their sermons with examples from German or Italian life.7
        To what extent did the Galician parish priest take an interest
in the building of a Ukrainian Christian culture and in the guiding
of secular culture in accord with Christian principles? Presumably,
few had the leisure to indulge in such interests. Overwhelmingly
rural, they had little access to the "high" culture of the city. Yet those
that could afford subscriptions to journals like Dzvony could
acquaint themselves with the writings of Ukrainian writers such as
Antonych or foreign ones like Mauriac. Even in the poor parishes of
the Lemko region, priests' private libraries included works of such
contemporary writers as Bohdan Lepkyi and Ulas Samchuk (as well

as foreign classics like Baizac, Jules Verne, Dostoevsky, Gogol,
Toisthy, Mickiewicz, Brontéç Dickens, and Jack London).750
        There were also a few priests who entertained great ambitions
to develop a Ukrainian religious culture on a par with those of other
European nations. Thus, Fr. I. Chekhovych wished th create a shrine
at Chaikovychi near Sambir that would gain international renown as
a "Ukrainian Lourdes." Fr. Chekhovych also promoted the fame of
the stigmatic Evstakhiia Bokhniak, 75 ' while Fr. Petro Dzedzyk
supported (though with some reservations) the claims of "the first
Ukrainian stigmatic," Nastya Voloshyn of Mlyny in the Iavoriv
dlistrict. 752 These initiatives, while naive and at times comical, can all
be understood as part of a general effort to create a national Catholic
culture modelled on those of the great Catholic nations of Europe.
        Thus, at least some members of the Greek-Catholic clergy took
part in the search for a new cultural orientation. This orientation,
defined by the relative importance assigned to Eastern and Western
influences, spanned secular as well as specifically ecclesiastical
culture. Although the Stanyslaviv eparchy, where the clergy came
under the directives of Bishop Khomyshyn's own philosophy of
church and secular culture, seems to have been an exception, there
too, an attempt was made at cultural self-definition. In all three
eparchies, the Greek-Catholic clergy lived in an atmosphere in
which a new synthesis was being developed of Western and Eastern
ecclesiastical traditions, and in which a new symbiosis of sacred and
secular culture was being forged.

     CHAPTER EIGHT: THE SENSE OF MISSION OF
       THE GREEK-CATHOLIC PARISH PRIEST

       The reform of the Greek-Catholic clergy in Galicia contributed
to a new sense of national, political, cultural and even religious
identity. Along with this new identity came a new sense of mission.
The Greek-Catholic priest was conscious of his special role both in
Galician Ukrainian society and in the greater plan of the Catholic
Church in the East. Before the mission of the clergy could be
clarified, however, its relationship to the activity of the Ukrainian
secular intelligentsia had to be worked out. In particular, the activist
clergy were faced with a practical and ideological challenge from the
Ukrainian nationalist movement. Their response to this challenge
was to propose an alternative (though not necessarily exclusive)
scenario: the vision of church Union, expressed in martial imagery
that echoed the militant spirit of contemporary nationalism. Only a
response that transcended the nationalist programme in scope and
appeal could re-establish Church and clergy as leaders of Galician
Ukrainian society.

1. Clergy and Intelligentsia: Cooperation or Competition?

       John-Paul Himka, citing Miroslav Hroch, maintains that like
the clergy in other national movements, the Ukrainian Greek-
Catholic clergy played a major role in the early stages of the
Ukrainian movement, but gradually lost the lead to the secular
intelligentsia. 753 However, Himka goes on to state that while the
Greek-Catholic Church did withdraw somewhat from the national
movement, in doing so it re-affirmed the spirituality that had
suffered during in the period of the clergy's heavy social involvement.
This enabled it to maintain a position of moral leadership.
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi succeeded, he writes, "in restoring the

       Himka, John-Paul. "Priests and Peasants: the Greek Catholic Pastor
and the Ukrainian National Movement in Austria, 1867-1900," Canadian
Slavonic Papers (Ottawa) vol. XXI, no. 1, reprinted in The Greek Catholic
Church and Ukrainian Society in Austrian Galicia. Cambridge, Massachusetts,
1986, 1. Contemporary observers indeed felt that the secular intelligentsia had
taken over the leadership of the Ukrainian movement. Having said, this,
however, Doroshenko points out that in the inter-war period the Church again
assumed a leading role in national life. Doroshenko 25.
                          234

 Ukrainian Catholic church as an independent moral and spiritual
 authority, allied to the national movement, but separate and
 critical."754
         This re-orientation of a secularised Church losing its grasp on
 the national movement to a position of moral leadership required a
reformation of the clergy involving, as has been seen, a new
 emphasis on spiritual formation as well as a clear sense of direction.
 In forming its sense of direction, the clergy was forced to decide how
it would regard the rising secular intelligentsia that had taken over
the leadership of the national movement. Should it compete with the
intelligentsia, or seek to cooperate? How this question was
approached on the parish level, particularly with regard to the
control of the reading-rooms, has already been discussed in some
detail in Chapter Five. In this section more general clerical opinions
on relations with the secular intelligentsia will be examined.
         The Greek-Catholic clergy entered the twentieth century with
a consciousness of its past contributions to the development of
Ruthenian society and a desire to continue in its leading role despite
opposition from anti-clerical circles of the intelligentsia. At the L'viv
Provincial Synod of 1891 it was noted that future priests were to be
"the light of the world and the salt of the earth and the leaders of the
people." 755 In the published proceedings of the Peremyshi' eparchial
synod of 1898 it was remarked that the Greek-Catholic priest must
continue to educate himself, "as the representative of his high state,
as a teacher and leader of the people." 756 Responding to a letter from
the Reading-room Society of the Lviv seminary in 1899 or 1900 Marko
Murava, a priest and poet who had studied at the seminary nearly
thirty years earlier, wrote that in the anti-clerical atmosphere of the
time the clergy had to make special efforts to maintain their
leadership of society:
             It seems that we must achieve our position
          among the people through unceasing labour --
          and defend ourselves from the attacks of the
          worldly and the calumnies of the callous
          through learning. We must join in with every

        Himka 446.

           enterprise consciously, so that we might achieve
           the heights in every field of knowledge, lest we be
           accused of ignorance and laziness... ."757

       Rev. Evstakhii Tsurkovs'kyi, writing in Nyva in 1911,
reminded his fellow priests that it was the Greek-Catholic clergy
which had initiated the Ruthenian revival, organised education and
social, economic and political life, created the Ruthenian
intelligentsia, and established stores, banks, village cooperatives,
reading-rooms, and so on. Such "clericalism," he argued, did not
serve merely the narrow interests of a "caste." It had made it possible
for the Ruthenians to resist the initiatives of the Galician viceroy
Badeni and the Poles. To defeat the Ruthenians, however, the Poles
were now using the Radicals in the task of "breaking respect for the
clergy as leaders of the people" and destroying the cooperation
between the priests and the populists. Thus, he wrote, the close ties
between clergy and people would be sundered, and the clergy would
lose its role as leader of the people -- a result desired by the Poles and
the Ruthenian Radicals alike.758
       In his article on the Lviv seminarians between 1900 and 1913,
written at the end of the latter year, Osyp Ostashevs'kyi stated that
"the development of our people, of our educational and economic
organisation, and nearly all our national achievements up to now we
owe to a great extent to the clergy, and for a long time yet the future
development of our people will depend on the attitudes which the
young clergy will take with them when they leave the walls of the
theological seminary." 759 An appeal "To the Ukrainian Clergy"
which appeared in Nyva in 1916 referred to "the glorious reputation
for patriotism and the reputation of leaders of the people which the
Ukrainian clergy has earned." 760 In 1935 Rev. Dr. Lev Hlynka,
advocating in Nyva the creation of a new organisation for the
priests of the Galician province, called for a renewed activism by the
clergy "as the leading class of Ukrainian society," which was to

struggle against the evils besetting "the Ukrainian Catholic Church
and the Ukrainian people." 76 ' Thus, throughout the development of
Ukrainian national consciousness between the turn of the century
and the 1930s, the clergy's sense of its role in society -- past, present,
and future -- remained constant.
      What exactly did leadership of Galician Ukrainian society
entail? A priest writing in 1916 argued that improvements in the
education of the clergy would demonstrate that they were, or should
be, bearers of Ukrainian culture among their own people, and would
make them the guardians of this culture. 762 Bidding farewell to the
departing students of the L'viv seminary around 1924, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi reminded them of the lack of thorough religious
education among the laity, and pointed to the superior religious
upbringing of the laity of other countries as an example to be
followed.763 One specific form of Western-style pastoral work was the
Catholic Action movement, held up as an example by the editors of
Nyva in 1937. The Greek-Catholic parish priest, they wrote, would
have to go beyond the church and into society in order to fulfill his
mission effectively. He would have to be sensitive to the pulse of
society and sufficiently flexible to react to every development. He
would have to work in social organisations, side by side with the
secular intelligentsia. This would enable the Greek-Catholic clergy,
following the example of the Polish clergy, to take national life into its
hands, remaining always in the front ranks of each lay organisation.
Thus it would lead the people not only to its eternal goal, but also "to
earthly prosperity, to temporal happiness, and to the attainment of
national ideals":
              We are a stateless nation; we have few leaders
           with a clearly developed world view based fully
           on Christian faith and morals; for this reason,
           until recently in all our national institutions
           there reigned a liberal, rationalist spirit. That

            today the situation is better is to the credit of the
            Church and the circumstance that today's
           intelligentsia throughout the world has turned to
            God, to eternal truths, to Christian ideals. And
            do we priests dare to leave this leading class of
            the people, which is seeking God and longs for
            eternal truths, alone,without leadership, without
           the signposts which it is seeking, perhaps as yet
           unconsciously, in its national work?!
               Our entire independent intelligentsia has
            undertaken national work according to its
            abilities. Only the clergy, which should be in the
            first ranks here as well and should set the tone
            for this work, would shrink from this, as if
            saying: our business is in the church, not in
            worldly institutions; we have higher, greater
            tasks in mind.764
       That the clergy should attempt to play a leading role in
Galician Ukrainian society was not self-evident to those who, like
Bishop Khomyshyn, saw that society as full of hostile elements. It
was the nationalist or communist laity that would draw the clergy
into following it, rather than the other way round. Furthermore,
hostile elements would seek to manipulate the Church to their own
ends. (See Chapter Five, Section 2.) In 1938 the clerical journal
Dobryi Pastyr, published in Stanyslaviv, listed among the four
enemies mounting a "General Attack upon our Greek-Catholic
Church" the liberals and various political groups wishing to impose
their will upon the Church.765
       Thus the Greek-Catholic clergy, conscious that the helm of
society was slipping from their hands, were torn between seeking to
wrest it back from the secular intelligentsia, and confining
themselves to spiritual and moral guidance exercised exclusively
from the pulpit. As their common political ground with the
increasingly nationalist intelligentsia became broader in the 1930s,
however, most of the clergy seem to have had no objections to working
together with lay leaders. 766 On the whole, Himka's description of
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's Church as "allied to the national
movement, but separate and critical" seems an accurate description

764    "Chy til'ky na holovnim vidtynku?" (editorial) Nyva 1937, no. 12, 412-

between the editors of Nyva and Bishop Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv on the
9uestion of clerical participation in lay organisations.

of the parish clergy. To what extent the clergy could maintain a
separate and critical stance was tested, however, by the rise of a
militantly nationalist movement in the 1930s which advanced new
ideals ultimately incompatible with Church teaching.

2. The Challenge of Integral Nationalism

       Hugh Seton-Watson ascribes two basic meanings to the term
"nationalism." The first is "a doctrine about the character, interests,
rights and duties of nations." The second is "an organised political
movement, designed to further the alleged aims and interests of
nations." Such movements generally aim at independence, that is,
the creation of a sovereign state in which the given nation is
dominant, and national unity, through the incorporation within the
frontiers of the state of all groups which are considered (by
themselves or by those who claim th speak for them) to belong to the
nation. 767 Anthony D. Smith defines nationalism as "an ideological
movement for the attainment and maintenance of autonomy,
cohesion and individuality for a social group deemed by some of its
members to constitute an actual or potential nation."768
       Under these definitions, both a nationalist ideology and a
nationalist movement could be found in inter-war Galicia, though
the movement (with nineteenth-century roots) appears to have
preceded the ideology. The movement was carried forward in the
1920s by the Ukrainian Military Organisation and in the 1930s by the
Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, generally following models
of "integral nationalism" and drawing on the Italian fascist
example. The ideology was developed primarily by the Eastern
Ukrainian emigre Dmytro Dontsov.769
       Integral nationalism is considered to have arisen in the
thinking of Charles Maurras and the Action Francaise at the turn of
the century. Influential in Eastern Europe as well as in Germany
and Italy, it was characterised by the following:
       1) a belief in the nation as the supreme value;

Nations and the Politics of Nationalism. London, 1977, 3.

Littleton, Colorado, 1980.
                           239

       2) an appeal to mystically conceived ideas of national
solidarity;
       3) subordination of rational thought to "intuitively correct"
emotions;
       4) expression of the "national will" through a charismatic
leader and an elite organised in a party; and
       5) glorification of action, violence and war as an expression of
the nation's superior biological vitality.770
       In western Ukraine, a modified version of integral
nationalism took root in the 1920s among the Ukrainian Military
Organisation (UVO) and the Union of Ukrainian Nationalistic Youth
(SUNM). The latter consisted of student youth who had turned from
communism to nationalism under the influence of Dmytro Dontsov,
whose ideas derived from those of German nationalists rather than
from those of Maurras or the Italian nationalists. Differing in part
from integral nationalism, Dontsov's ideology stressed, among
others, the following points:
       1) advocacy of terrorism as the only available means of
opposition to the dominant group;
       2) absolute adherence to the "pure" national language and
culture;
       3) in the absence of a Ukrainian national state, and given the
nationalists' opposition to existing states, glorification of
"illegality;"
       4) ideologically motivated irrationalism expressed through
fantastic romanticism;
       5) rejection of the moderation and compromise of the elder
generation and reliance on youth.771
       In addition, Ukrainian nationalism was influenced by the
Russian revolutionary tradition as typified, for example, by the
"Narodnaia Volia" of the 1870s, and by Bolshevik methods. At the
same time, liberal democratic and Christian principles, as well as
respect for formal learning, established authority, individual
decision and popular choice, exerted an influence on this movement.
       In the 1920s the UVO and the SUNM won over nearly all
politically active elements in western Ukraine except for the

moderate parties. Closely interconnected, the two groups merged
formally in 1929 with the founding of the Organisation of Ukrainian
Nationalists (OliN). Under the leadership of Col. Ievhen Konovalets',
former commander of the Sich Sharpshooters, the OUN carried on
the struggle by both legal and illegal means.772
       Who were the bearers of Ukrainian nationalism in inter-war
Galicia? V. Kiernan observes that nationalism generally draws
support from a "loose bundle of lower-middle-class groupings"
consisting of "unattached, unanchored individuals or clusters" --
"the irregulars of history." 773 In Galicia, the growing number of
unemployed Ukrainian youth from the countryside, prevented by
state policy from entering university or excluded from jobs or
professions, were the main source of cadres for the Ukrainian
nationalist movement. They were also a source of candidates for the
priesthood, since the seminary offered a higher education for those
unable to obtain it elsewhere, and the priesthood offered a livelihood
for educated youth whose political involvement barred their way to
state employment or the free professions. It is thus no surprise that
the seminaries became hot-beds of nationalist sentiment. At the
same time, the fact that the typical young parish priest of the 1930s
shared common roots with the typical nationalist in the highly
religious countryside, and that some leading nationalists came from
the families of village priests (see Chapter Four), helps to explain the
persistence of religiosity among nationalists, and perhaps of mystic
and quasi-religious elements in nationalist thought. Ukrainian
nationalist ideologists sought to demonstrate that their ideology was
not opposed to Christian principles, and explicitly recognised the
Church's place in society.774
       Anthony Smith notes that although a nationalist movement
needs only an intelligentsia, its efforts are more likely to enjoy rapid
success if it can recruit from among one or another of the principal
urban middle-class status groups. 775 Indeed, lay nationalists saw in
the higher Greek-Catholic clergy a prestigious and influential ally.
As Smith also points out, the classlessness of nationalist ideology

certainly by a Soviet agent, on 23 May 1938.

makes possible its acceptance by social strata with conflicting aims,
with the result that a single national movement may accommodate
various competing nationalisms. 776 Thus, the Ukrainian national
movement included both the conservative nationalism of the higher
urban clergy and the radical nationalism of the Ukrainian Military
Organisation and the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN).
The nationalism of the village clergy seems to have fallen somewhere
between these two types, caught as they were between their
conservative superiors in the city and their radical neighbours in the
countryside.
       These types of nationalism, and the social groups by which
they were borne, did indeed come into conflict. This was not only
because of the differences in approach between the lay nationalists
and the clergy, but also because of the inherent nature of nationalist
ideology itself. Smith observes that a strong, developed nationalist
movement, with its "set of clearly articulated myths and rites," is a
kind of religion surrogate. Of course, it is not to be confused with
religion, since it is limited to human, terrestrial categories. As "a
secular doctrine of autonomy and individuality," nationalism
generally meets the condemnation of traditionalist priests, who see it
"as godless and arrogant perversion." 777 In particular, they are
likely to object to the nationalist rejection of traditional, supernatural
explanations of the nation's destiny, which is seen rather as "a
theatre for social action which men by their own volition can mould
to their ideals." 778 With its idealism, mysticism, messianism and call
for sacrifice, not to mention its unique moral code (which even
included a special nationalist "decalogue"), Ukrainian nationalism
as expounded by Dmytro Dontsov and his followers can indeed be
seen as a religion surrogate. 779 At the same time, with its emphasis
on voluntarism, heroism and violence, it represented a rejection or at
least a modification of the Christian view of national destiny.

        See Prus, 165 for examples of quasi-religious elements in Ukrainian
nationalist ideology. These, of course, were put forth by nationalist authors to
show that nationalism tended to harmonise with Christianity, rather than
replace it. Prus also cites a work by D. Shtukal', Nad svitom siiaie khrest mecha
(L'viv, 1936), in which the author allegedly describes nationalism as a new
religion, but one to which Christianity was not alien; indeed, the cross and
sword, identical in their forms, symbolised the harmony of the two ideologies.

        Officially, OlIN ideology was friendly toward the Church and
 toward religion in general. The decisions of the organisation's
 founding congress in January-February 1929 characterised religious
belief as a personal matter, and guaranteed protection of "full liberty
 of religious conscience" by the future Ukrainian state. The Church
was to be separated from the state, but some state control over the
Church would be needed. In the matter of the moral upbringing of
the nation, the state would cooperate with the Ukrainian clergy of the
various denominations. Those cults which did not exhibit
denationalising tendencies would be allowed to provide religious
education in the schools. The Ukrainian state would encourage the
development of a Ukrainian national Church independent of foreign
religious authorities, as well as the Ukrainisation of religious cults
functioning in the country.78°
        The problem of the relationship between Catholicism and
ideological nationalism was one of which at least the leaders of the
Greek-Catholic clergy were aware. A series of twelve public lectures
sponsored by the Theological Scholarly Society and the Ukrainian
Catholic Seniors in L'viv from January to April 1934 was to include a
lecture on 25 March by Rev. Prof. Dr. Mykola Konrad of the L'viv
Academy on "Catholicism and Nationalism." 781 The problem had
been posed in 1922 by Rev. Dr. Havryil Kostel'nyk in an article in
Nyva, reprinted as a pamphlet. Admitting that nationalism had
become a leading force in society and that there was a tendency
towards a "church nationalism," Rev. Kostel'nyk distinguished the
notion that the clergy must be "sincerely national" from that of
"church nationalism." The latter would lead to the creation of an
autocephalous Church; for Catholics, however, there could be only
one head of the Church, namely the Pope, and indeed only one
Church, rather than a multiplicity of national Churches. Besides,
wrote Kostel'nyk, church nationalism would lead to secularisation of
the Church and to the apotheosis of the Nation, and thus to
paganism. At the same time, the clergy had to be truly national, and
to achieve this it had to "go to the people." It was precisely through its

 ability to create its own Christian social order that the Church could
 maintain its independence from the state -- by contrast with the
 Orthodox Church, which because of its retreat into feigned
 spirituality had allowed the State to dominate society. Thus, while he
 condemned church nationalism as leading to subordination of the
 Church to temporal power, he advocated national activity by the
clergy as a means of promoting Christian values in society and
protecting the Church from state interference.782
        The church historian Mykola Chubatyi sought to define the
relationship between national and spiritual re-birth in an article
which appeared in "Nova Zoria" in 1927. Rejecting the materialistic
notion of national re-birth through social revolution, he declared that
the moral renewal of the individual was the basis of true re-birth. He
criticised the idea, rooted in Caesaropapism, that religion and the
Church should serve as means for furthering national interests.
Religion had its own aims, directed towards enlivening the spirit of
the individual and preparing him for moral action and sacrifice for
the sake of others. It was precisely this renewal of the individual that
would make possible the re-birth of the nation. Once Christian
idealism conquered the souls of the people, the resurrection of
Ukraine could come about.783
        As Galician society became polarised between left and right in
the 1930s, along with a general shift to the right among the
intelligentsia, the distinction between anti-communism and radical
nationalism became difficult to maintain. In Stanyslaviv, of course,
Bishop Khomyshyn found no difficulty in combining a strong anti-
communism with an antipathy to the nationalist movement.784
However, there was some social pressure on the Church to adopt the
nationalist stance, and with the perceived growth of communist
sentiment (particularly after the disorders of 1936), nationalism may
have seemed the only recourse. Thus, in 1937 the lay leader Markiian
Dzerovych wrote to Bishop Khomyshyn pointing out that nationalism
was the only force besides Christianity that was able to counter-act

communism, and urged the coexistence of nationalism and
Catholicism. He felt that the ideology of the OUN harmonised the
ideology of Christ with that of "healthy, creative Christian
nationalism." 785 It is a commonplace in anti-Uniate polemics of
Marxist-Leninist writers that the Greek-Catholic clergy favoured
"Ukrainian fascism" in the form of the right-wing Organisation of
Ukrainian Nationalists. 786 The Greek-Catholic clergy could look to
Mussolini's Italy, where an accommodation between Church and
State had been reached in 1929, for an example of an understanding
between the Church and a fascist movement. 787 According th Edward
Prus, on 1 October 1936 Rev. Myron Hornykevych of St. Barbara's
Greek-Catholic church in Vienna wrote to Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi
warning him against a struggle on two fronts -- against the
nationalists as well as the communists -- since it was the
communists who were the real enemy. 788 On the other hand, both
Italy and Germany could provide examples of outright conflict
between Catholics and fascists •789
      Reporting on the general meeting of the Society of St. Andrew
in L'viv in 1935, Rev. Iuliian Dzerovych noted that the head of the
Society had spoken in the autumn of 1934 with the Apostolic Visitator
Jan Hudenek and had refuted "the unjust calumnies against our
clergy, which supposedly is educating its faithful in a radically
chauvinistic, ultranational spirit." He also reported that the English
press had carried libelous accounts of clerical participation in anti-
Semitic actions in Galicia. 790 As mentioned in Chapter Six, official

he acknowledges that both clergy and bishops varied in their attitudes towards
nationalism, and that those who did favour fascism looked to the Italian rather
than the German model.

supported the Italian fascist movement, which served as a model for the OUN.

Polish sources contain many reports of nationalistic activity by
Greek-Catholic priests in the 1930s.
      Nevertheless, the rise of an organised, conspiratorial
nationalist movement posed a serious challenge to the Ukrainian
clergy and the Church as a whole. They could not condone acts such
as the attempted assassination of President Wojciechowski by the
Ukrainian Military Organisation in 1924, or the successful
assassination of a Polish school superintendent two years later. In
1929-1930 the newly formed Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists
(OUN) conducted a series of bombings, attacks on post offices,
sabotage of railways and telegraph facilities, and burning of estates.
791 The Polish journalist and politician Tadeusz Ho6wko, an
advocate of Polish-Ukrainian cooperation, was murdered in 1931. On
15 June 1934 the OUN assassinated the Minister of Internal Affairs
Bronis1aw Pieracki in Warsaw. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi sent
condolences to the Premier. 792 On 25 July OUN member Roman
Savchuk shot and killed the Ukrainian secondary school director
Ivan Babii, the first director of the Archeparchial Institute of
Catholic Action and an organiser of the previous year's "Ukrainian
Youth for Christ" rally (see below), who had forbidden OUN
recruitment among his students. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi
denounced the action in no uncertain terms.793

the murder by "Ukrainian terrorists," but also of their campaign to recruit youth
into underground activity. He also characterised the clergy and episeopate as a
barrier to this "criminal and foolish work." The metropolitan stressed that "a
crime is always a crime, that one cannot serve a holy cause with blood-stained
hands." He who demoralises youth, he wrote, is 'a criminal and an enemy of
the people." "Holos Mytropolyta," "Dilo" no. 205 (5 August 1934), p. 3. The

        Perhaps the first major test of clerical-nationalist relations in
 Galicia, however, was the "Youth for Christ" congress which took
 place in L'viv on 5-7 May 1933. Bishop Ivan Buchko of L'viv headed
 the commission organising this massive youth rally on the
 nineteenth centenary of the Redemption. The Organisation of
Ukrainian Nationalists opposed the event and sought to discourage
the youth from attending it. Nevertheless, some 100,000 young
persons from all over Galicia participated. Greeting them at the
opening of the event on Saturday, 6 May, Bishop Buchko expressed
his joy that they had overcome all obstacles to come to L'viv. On the
next day a mass was celebrated, a message from the Pope was read
out, and the participants took an oath of fidelity to Christ. An attempt
by the Communist Youth League to hand out leaflets was quickly
foiled. A massive march proceeded past a dais before St. George's
Cathedral, where Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi blessed the crowd. At a
programme held that evening at the Great Theatre, a choir sang the
Papal hymn in Italian, and the student R. Montsibovych, remarking
that paganism was now being re-born in the form of fanatical
nationalism, called upon Ukrainians to stand up in the battle against
paganism.
       According to one account, the OUN's opposition to the
"Ukrainian Youth for Christ" rally resulted from the organisers'
refusal to retract an invitation to representatives of the Polish state
authorities and the Polish episcopate to sit in the "honorary
presidium." Thus, the conflict is described as political, not
religious. 795 Whatever the case may have been, what is significant
here is that in the struggle between the clergy and the OT.JN activists
to win the loyalty of Ukrainian Galician youth, in this instance the
clergy clearly won.

       Nevertheless, it was also clear that the clergy's role as leaders
of the people was being challenged directly. In order to maintain
their lead, they would have to mobilise the laity towards a
programme of social action offering a real alternative to the
nationalist programme. There was of course a danger of involving
the Church in politics. If the nationalists insisted on characterising
religious activities as political, as in the "Youth for Christ" affair,
this could hardly be avoided. Indeed, during this time religious
matters were becoming politicised, while with the growth of
mystical-revolutionary nationalism, politics was becoming
spiritualised. The clergy would have to find a way to lead the people
towards spiritual goals that transcended the political goals towards
which the radical nationalists were beckoning.
       One answer was to found a Ukrainian Catholic organisation
that could influence public, especially political life. In October 1930,
with the Galician Ukrainians frightened and demoralised by the
brutal "pacification" in the countryside, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi
prompted several lay and clerical leaders, including Rev. Petro
Holyns'kyi and Rev. losyf Rakovs'kyi, to organise the Ukrainian
Catholic People's Party. The Party would disseminate Catholic social
teaching, advocating social harmony in a corporative social
structure, and opposing the notion of class struggle. On 22 October
1930 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi declared the need for a Ukrainian
Christian organisation maintaining a position of legality vis a vis the
state while seeking to develop Ukrainian culture, education,
prosperity and civil rights. Members would be free in matters of
political activity as long as they acted according to Catholic faith and
morals. This declaration was republished in March of the following
year as the programme of the new Ukrainian Catholic Union in its
organ, the newspaper "Meta." 796 To these were added the Catholic
Action movement (see Chapter FIve) and the Catholic Action of

796 "Meta" (L'viv) year I, no. 1 (15 March 1931), P. 1. Originally it had been
published in the L'viv secular daily "Dilo" on 26 October 1930. The Union was
founded at a meeting on 1 January 1931. "Meta" was edited by Rev. Petro
Khomyn, later editor of Nyva. In 1932 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, stating that the
idea of a "Catholic political party" was a contradiction in terms, reaffirmed that
the Ukrainian Catholic Union was not a political organisation. Politics meant
controversy, whereas the Party's goals were not controversial among the
Ukrainians, who supported them unanimously -- though "others," who might not
agree with these goals, could consider them "political." Andrei, Mytropolyt.

Ukrainian Youth. The Catholic activist Volodymyr Detsykevych
allegedly told Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi that all the bishops and
prominent priests had joined in the work of the Ukrainian Catholic
Union.797
       To some Polish observers, the Greek-Catholic clergy was
excessively nationalistic. Henryk Ignacy Lubieiski remarked in 1934
that he doubted that the Galician Ukrainians felt much sympathy for
the Uniates of Kholm (Chem) who had suffered persecution in
connection with the imposition of Orthodoxy by Russia in 1875,
especially those who had joined the Latin rite after the Edict of
Toleration of 1905. The reason was that these Uniates had become
Poles, whereas if they had converted to Orthodoxy they might still
have become Ukrainians. To the Greek-Catholic clergy, wrote
Lubienski, the plight of these ex-Uniates was not nearly as important
as the Austrian persecution of the Orthodox just before and during
World War One. As a result of nationalist antagonisms, the Uniate
tradition had lost its most important values; indeed, Ruthenian
nationalism sometimes portrayed the Union itself as a Polish-Roman
intrigue. Greek-Catholic priests feared latinisation; some
complained of Polish influence in the Roman Curia. Nationalism,
characterised by a hatred of Poland, had ruined the Uniate traditions
and strengthened those of Orthodoxy. 798 Lubieiiski continued:
               In such a state of affairs it is not strange that
            the Church, the sacristy, the rectory, and even
            the pulpit and the confessional often are
            becoming a point of support or a site of militant
            nationalism; that acts of violence, sabotage and
            terror have been accepted by the broad masses of
            the clergy not only in silence, but even with their
            moral ratification; that in relation to the
            elemental power represented by nationalism,
            Catholicism can barely vegetate; that
            nationalism is creating a chasm between Greek
            and Latin Catholicism which is a threat to the
            unity of the Catholic Church and to the idea of
            this Church's universality.799

        As an example of nationalism amongst the Greek-Catholic
 clergy, Lubieiiski cited the fact that the clergy of the Stanyslaviv
 eparchy silently acquiesced or even took part in the campaign
 against their Bishop. In Lubietcski's view, Bishop Khomyshyn
 desired to take nationalism in a new direction, one in accord with the
 teaching of Christ.800
        Some Greek-Catholic parish priests did sense the tendency of
politics, including nationalist politics, to overshadow their work. On
 14 October 1936 Rev. Roman Starodub spoke at the Bukova deanery
meeting (Peremyshi' eparchy) on the topic 'How Should one Strive to
Revive and Uplift Practical Religiosity in the Parish?" Approved by
the priests in attendance, who resolved to be guided by it in their
pastoral work, the talk enumerated, among the various ills of the age,
Bolshevism and "extreme national chauvinism."801
       At the meeting of the Korosno (Krosno) deanery of 24 June
 1937, Rev. Aleksii Bilevych spoke on the theme "A Popular [narodnal
or a Catholic [soborna] Church?" He criticised nationalism for
putting the nation above all other things, including faith and
religion, as in Germany. This attitude, he added, could be found
among Ukrainians too. Although nationalism in the sense of a love
for one's people was good, the love of God must come first. The
nationalists, however, put the nation before God, and sought to make
the Church "narodna." Orthodoxy could be seen as a "Greek national
schism" resulting from excessive national pride. Complaints about
"latinisation" and "polonisation" were merely rationalisations for
church populism. Rev. Bilevych stated that the Church of Christ
could not be "narodna," for the teaching of Christ is for all nations. It
is a supra-national, catholic (soborna) Church. In fact, as an
international phenomenon it coincides with Communism, and for
this reason the Hitlerites accuse the Catholic clergy of communist
sympathies. Of course, the Church respects national cultures and
national rights. It even develops patriotism among the faithful.
However, it develops a patriotism that "rests on higher foundations
that those of the nationalists -- for [it rests] upon the Lord God."
Unlike a national Church, the Catholic Church wisely reconciles a
people's eternal interests with its secular interests. Thus, the
800   Lubiercski 553.
801   WAP-P, AAL 39, pp. 56-58.
                           250

Church not only leads the people to eternal life, but teaches it a
healthy patriotism and nationalism which proceed from the faith
and the Commandments. By contrast false nationalism -- that is,
nationalism without God -- leads to Communism. In the discussion
following Fr. Bilevych's talk, Rev. Mykhailo Tsolta remarked that the
foundation of nationalism was materialism. The dean, Rev. Kiufas,
added that a national Church could not be "soborna" ("catholic"),
because it did not satisfy man's spiritual needs.802
      At the meeting of the Zhukotyn deanery of 1 June 1939 Rev.
Teodor Boiko predicted that the Boshevik and nationalist camps
would arise among the Ukrainian people "as nowhere else. " "Our
task, therefore, is through hard work not only to paralyse all
influences of Bolshevism and atheism in the national camp, but also
to cleanse the national camp itself from the fatal tenets of modern
times." This could only be done by reviving the apostolic spirit of the
early Christians.803
      The outbreak of war a few months later cut short the evolution
of Greek-Catholic clerical thought on the question of nationalism as
an ideology, as well as the development of relations between the
clergy and the secular nationalist intelligentsia. Thus, neither the
ideological conflict nor the practical question of cooperation or
competition between the two groups was ever resolved.

3. The Clerical Vanguard

      It does appear that at least some Greek-Catholic parish priests
had a strong sense of mission. "A new Christian age is being created
before our very eyes, and it is being created by enthusiastic labourers,
apostles of the Kingdom of Christ," wrote Rev. Vasyl' Pryshliak in
Nyva in 1935.804 At a meeting of the Ukrainian Catholic Union in
1934, another priest stated that "We are the vanguard of Catholic
Europe." 805 In February of that year a priest writing anonymously in

Nyva proposed as a goal of the Greek-Catholic clergy "to seek all
possible ways by which we can revive today's paganised world."806
       Whatever might be the special mission of the Greek-Catholic
clergy, it required a special type of individual. According to "a young
priest" writing in "Nova Zoria" in 1927, "today the spirit of the age
requires a type of priest different from those of several decades ago."
To produce this new type of priest was the task of the seminaries.
"Today a priest is expected to come to the village with total initiative
with regard to all manifestations of social life." Among other things,
the priest had to be familiar with the aims of his Church's
enemies. 807 Such a new type of clergy could in fact be regarded as a
new elite. Based on the philosophical writings of Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi and forming an important part of the nationalist
philosophy, there arose in Ukrainian Galician society the concept of
Ukrainian elitism and even messianism, in which the central role
was to be played by the Greek-Catholic clerical elite.808
       If the clerical elite was to provide leadership for Ukrainian
society, whether as an alternative to the nationalist vanguard or in
cooperation with it, it had to point toward a concrete goal. Such a goal
was provided by the ideal of Union. Insofar as Union meant the
unification of all Ukrainians in a single Church, it was in harmony
with two goals of Ukrainian nationalism: the creation of a single
Ukrainian state, and the defeat of atheistic Communism. The
broader understanding of Union, for example as envisaged by
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, meant the eventual merger of the Catholic
and Orthodox Churches and the conversion of the peoples of the
Soviet Union. It involved the creation of a Russian and a Belorussian
Catholic Church of the eastern rite -- a task begun by Sheptyts'kyi
during his sojourn in Russia in 1914-1917, and one obviously favoured
by Rome, particularly after the prophecies of Fatima.
      The goal of church Union extended the parish priest's
horizons well beyond the parish. Citing a "secret" pastoral letter of

Austro-German offensive of that year as an opportunity for the
Greek-Catholic clergy (presumably referring to those serving as
chaplains in the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen) to carry the missionary
work of Union into Russia. 809 The Rules of the L'viv theological
seminary stated explicitly that the Ukrainan clergy had the special
responsibility to carry out the will of Pope Urban VIII, 'per vos mei
Rutheni Orientem convertendum spero." The Rules also stated that
they must be ready for self-denial and sacrifice. 810 At the very
beginning of his reign as Metropolitan, Andrei Sheptyts'kyi had
called upon his priests to prepare for a sacrifice of blood.81'
       It was thus only natural that the Greek-Catholic clergy's sense
of mission should often be expressed in martial terms. In his 1905
pasthral letter to the clergy of the Stanyslaviv eparchy on the activity
of priests, Bishop Khomyshyn berated them for their worldly ways,
lamenting the lack of "souls strongly tempered for holy battle."812
After 1917, the militant anti-religious policy of the Bolsheviks and, in
the late 1930s, the atmosphere of impending war, rendered the
possibility of self-sacrifice altogether likely and the martial metaphor
all too appropriate. In the introduction to the 1937 student almanac of
the Peremyshl' seminary, the editors wrote that "we live on the
borderlands of the Catholic Church along which, like the first
columns of soldiers on the front, we struggle in direct conflict with
hellish enemies, in order to hold the Church's positions." 813 Rev.
Shranakh of the Peremyshl' eparchy, speaking at Dobrohostiv on 29
November 1934 on the subject of Catholic Action, elaborated the
metaphor:

              Let every pastor remember that he becomes a
           general who must train soldiers who, under the
           banner of Christ and in the name of His lofty
           ideas, would go boldly and bravely to battle and
           victory to win humanity for the Kingdom of
           Christ.814

        In his talk before the Zhukotyn deanery meeting cited above,
Rev. Teodor Boiko said that at a time when "we stand on the
threshold of great changes, and at the same time perhaps of great
ruin and destruction, we priests, as almost the sole leaders of the
people, have the weighty responsibility to arm the people
spiritually." 815 Looking back on the inter-war period, one author has
called the graduates of the L'viv academy the "vanguard" which
would break down the wall between the Christian East and West.816
       Thus, at a time of feverish nationalism and anticipation of war
in the East, the Greek-Catholic clergy offered Ukrainian society a
vision of reconciliation between East and West through a Union of
Churches, expressed in martial images. At the same time it
presented a Catholic alternative to the nationalist and communist
ideologies. In doing so, it made its bid to regain the leadership of
Ukrainian Galician society as a new clerical elite, wavering between
competition and cooperation with the Ukrainian secular
intelligentsia.

                         CONCLUSION
    The Transformation of the Greek-Catholic Clergy in
                          Galicia

       Most of the conclusions reached in this dissertation confirm
common views. Between 1900 and 1939, the Old Ruthenian tendency
dwindled to extinction in most of Galicia, although in an unexpected
way the Russophile and Orthodox motifs would later be taken up
with the formal absorption of the Greek-Catholic Church by the
Russian Orthodox Church in 1946. The Greek-Catholic clergy
became almost solidly Ukrainian in national orientation, and for the
most part moderately nationalist in political sympathies. It remained
divided, however, between the Byzantinist and the Westernising (or
latinising) tendencies, with the former predominating. Less familiar
is its attitude towards secular culture, which in some cases was
ambiguous but which on the whole involved a ready adoption of the
version of Ukrainian history and culture being put forward by the
national intelligentsia. In adopting this version, the clergy to some
extent resolved, to some extent ignored certain apparent problems
and contradictions arising from a strictly Catholic point of view.
       The common view that the Greek-Catholic clergy cooperated
with the secular nationalist movement, although generally true,
requires some refinement. There seems little support for the notion,
advanced by Soviet historiography, that the clergy uniformly
supported the radical nationalists. As has been seen, not only the
episcopate but a number of parish priests could not reconcile
ideological Ukrainian nationalism (integral nationalism) with
Christian ethics. On the other hand, a more moderate kind of
nationalism appears to have found almost universal support among
the Greek-Catholic clergy. Nevertheless, while the parish priests
may not have been concerned with theoretical inconsistencies
between religion and nationalism, and could work with the village
intelligentsia, the ultimate conflict in values and the question of
social leadership were never resolved. The events of the war and the
liquidation of the Church in 1945-1946 froze the status quo of 1939.
       In view of wartime and post-war events, the ideal of Union has
been obscured. As has been seen, it became an important element in
the developing "mentality" of the Greek-Catholic clergy in Galicia,
                        255

due in great part to the ecumenical guidance of Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi. His vision of church Union, extending beyond the
horizons of contemporary nationalism, was grasped by few and
certainly went beyond the concerns of the average parish priest.
However, it did animate some seminary graduates. Although the
events of both world wars at first seemed to open up possibilities for
Union work, in the event this ideal was frustrated by post-war
fortunes. Just as a number of issues debated during the period under
study were never resolved, so the process of the transformation of the
Greek-Catholic parish clergy was never completed. Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi's educational reforms had little time to bear fruit. The
consequences of compulsory clerical celibacy could never be studied
under normal conditions. The ideal of a clerical vanguard prepared
to lead Ukrainian society at home and spread the Union abroad
remained largely an ideal, though one of which many clerics were
vividly conscious.
        However, the metamorphosis of the Greek-Catholic priesthood
did prepare it for the trials predicted by Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi,
Bishop Khomyshyn and other leaders. The clergy of 1945-1946 was
well prepared to endure the hardships of arrest, exile, persecution
and the life of a catacomb Church. In large measure, the changes
that took place amongst the clergy between 1900 and 1939 made
possible the survival of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church as an
illegal body for 43 years.
                     NOTE ON SOURCES

        There is no published study covering the subject of the Greek-
Catholic parish clergy from 1900 to 1939. F.I. Titov's detailed (if
opinionated) eyewitness description of this group as it existed at the
begining of the period, Russkoe dukhovenstvo v Galitsii (Kiev, 1903),
unfortunately has not been complemented by later accounts.
However, a number of published works deal with related subjects, in
particular with the Greek-Catholic Church during this period.
        A useful survey of post-war Polish historiography on the
Second Republic was published in volume LXIX of Przegld
Historvcznv in 1978 by Andrzej Garlicki, Tomasz Nacz, and
Wiesaw Wladyka. According to this article, the most fertile research
on inter-war Poland had been conducted in the 1960s, with Wieslaw
MysFek producing notable studies of the Catholic Church. The only
significant work concerning the Greek-Catholic Church between
1900 and 1939 to have been produced in Poland since 1978 is Edward
Prus' polemical but informative study of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi
(W}advka witojurski, 1985). However, the article by Fr. Tadeusz
  liwa on the Greek-Catholic Church in the inter-war period which
appeared in the collection KoScio1 w II Rzeczvpospolitej, published in
1980 at the Catholic University of Lublin under the editorship of
Zygmunt Zielii'iski and Stanisaw Wilk, summarises a good deal of
basic information. Also worthy of mention is Andrzej Ziba's
detailed and objective review article of Prus' work, in Kwartalnik
Historvcznv (1986).
        Soviet studies of the Greek-Catholic Church, among which
S.T. Danylenko's Dorohoiu han'bv i zrady ("By the Road of Shame
and Treason," Kiev, 1970) and Klym Dmytruk's Pid shtandartamy
reaktsii i fash yzmu (Kiev, 1976) can be regarded as typical, can be
informative but, as these titles suggest, are so polemical as to be of
little value in terms of analysis.
        The work of Ukrainian emigre authors has mostly focused on
the person of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi (Baran, Doroshenko,
Korolevskij, Laba, Prokoptschuk) and to a lesser extent on that of his
bishops (Mel'nychuk, Nazarko). Some of these tend to the panegyric
or the eulogy.
                        257


       Recent western works such as John-Paul Himka's studies of
the national movement in nineteenth and early twentieth-century
Galicia, and the collection Morality and Reality, on Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi (Paul R. Magocsi, editor; Edmonton, 1989) throw some
light on the life of the clergy. With regard to approach and analysis,
Gregory Freeze's studies of the Russian Orthodox parish clergy in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (1977, 1983) have served as a
partial model for this dissertation as well as a basis for comparison.
       Considerable insight into the developing mentality of the
Greek-Catholic parish clergy is provided by works published by the
priests themselves during the period under study (e.g., Rev. Havryil
Kostel'nyk). Among these are polemical pamphlets (Korytko,
Pryslopskii, Stefanovych). Those written by Polish Latin-rite priests
(Borodzicz) or laymen give some idea of the atmosphere in which the
Greek-Catholic clergy lived and worked.
       Although few, published memoirs by Greek-Catholic priests
concerning the period under study are invaluable. Chief among
these are the lengthy reminiscences of Rev. 0. Prystai, Rev. Fylymon
Tarnavs'kyi, and Rev. Tyt Voinarovs'kyi, as well as the shorter
wartime memoir of Rev. Petro Holyns'kyi and the seminary
reminiscences of Rev. Osyp Ostashevs'kyi and Rev. Nykolai
Voiakovs'kyi. The score or so of anthologies of articles and
reminiscences on various regions of western Ukraine published in
recent decades in the United States and Canada contain some
material on the Greek-Catholic clergy. The third volume of Svitvl'nvk
Istyny (Chicago, 1983) includes several brief memoirs on seminary
life.
       Apart from monographs and articles, the prime published
source for the Greek-Catholic clergy is the schematism, a periodical
(usually annual) directory of the parishes and clergy of a given
eparchy (diocese). Schematisms for the L'viv archeparchy and the
Peremyshl' and Stanyslaviv eparchies are available for most years
within the period under study.
       Of published documents relevant to the Greek-Catholic clergy
between 1900 and 1939, the most important are the various pastoral
letters of Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and the bishops of Peremyshi'
and Stanyslaviv. Some of the Metropolitan's pastoral letters are
included in the first volume of his works published in Toronto in
                         258

1965; this, however, covers only the first eight months of his tenure.
Naturally, certain Papal encyclicals, published in the Acta
Apostolicae Sedis, are of relevance as well. The proceedings of the
Provincial Synod held at L'viv in 1891 were published in 1896; these,
along with the published documents of the L'viv (1905), Peremyshi'
(1898) and Stanyslaviv (1908) eparchial synods, are an essential
source.
       The most important archival collections remain on the
territory of the Halych Metropolitanate, which is split between the
USSR and Poland. On the Polish side are th be found the collections of
the Greek-Catholic bishopric and cathedral chapter of PrzemyM, as
well as of the Lemko Apostolic Administration. All three collections
are in the state archive of the Przemyl województwo at Przemyl.
       The major problem in research for this dissertation was the
inaccessibility (until very recently) of archival materials to be found
in the Soviet Union. An excellent bibliography and institutional
directory for Soviet Ukrainian archives is the first book of Patricia
Kennedy Grimsted's Archives and Manuscript Depositories in the
USSR. Ukraine and Moldavia (Princeton, 1988). The Central State
Historical Archive in L'viv contains some 900 collections, some of
which concern the Greek-Catholic clergy. About a third of
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's archive reportedly is contained in
collection 358. It may well contain copies of reports by the
Metropolitan on the condition of his clergy. Until recently, this
collection was available only to a few Soviet scholars and almost
completely inaccessible to foreign scholars. Also useful, presumably,
would be collections 201 (Metropolitan Consistory) and 408
(Metropolitan Ordinariat), which should contain material on
administrative and disciplinary matters concering parish priests.
Collection 451, on the L'viv Theological Academy, would be of obvious
value. According to reports, all the collections in the archive are now
being made available.
       Various archives beyond the territory of the Halych
Metropolitanate contain relevant materials. The collections of the
Ministry of Religious Cults and Public Education and of the Ministry
of Internal Affairs at the Archiwum Akt Nowych in Warsaw contain
valuable information on Greek-Catholic priests in the inter-war
period. In London, the Archive of the Polish Institute contains
                        259


important Polish government collections such as those of the
ambassador to the Hoiy See, Pape. The State Archive at Vienna
contains material on the Greek-Catholic clergy during World War I.
The collection of the Polish Embassy in Washington, D.C. at the
Hoover Institution in Stanford, California includes some material on
Ukrainians in the Republic of Poland, including the Greek-Catholic
Church.
       For purposes of this dissertation a survey questionnaire was
sent out to 29 Greek-Catholic priests ordained in the three Galician
eparchies before September 1939. Seven responded. Personal
interviews were also conducted with five priests (two of them tape-
recorded) and one lay activist (tape-recorded) of the pre-war period.
While of very limited statistical value due to the smallness of the
sample, these materials contain many details which tend to confirm
or qualify the conclusions reached on the basis of other sources.
