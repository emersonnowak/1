in Vienna, positively affected our seminarians'
change of world view. They saw how our
intelligentsia in general had accepted western
civilisation, but only that civilisation that was
far from the fundamentals of Christ's teaching;
they were aware that such culture brings ruin
and not good for our society. In such
circumstances, the young theologians
understood that above all, it must adopt Catholic
religious ideas from the West and with them, to
colour the national and social aspects of our
people's life, and thus to react against the dark
forces of growing faithlessness.315
The secessionists were, however, a special case. In 1916 a
priest writing in Nyva criticised candidates returning from
foreignstudies. They may be pious and learned, he concedes, but they
make poor pastors and teachers of the people. For in the West, they
have become alienated from their Church and from their people's
rites and customs -- indeed, from the people themselves. They have
no regard for those things "that every sincere Ukrainian treasures."
Although they may obtain high positions in the church hierarchy,
they cannot influence the people bIuse they have become estranged
from them and from their culture.316
This last observation illustrates some of the dangers of overly
rapid assimilation of foreign cultural values, and foreshadows the
conflicts of the inter-war period. In these conflicts, parish priests
sometimes found common cause with the laity in criticising the
policies of their foreign-educated bishops. The parish clergy were
nearly all trained in the three Galician seminaries, where they could
benefit from the improvements in education while maintaining their
ties with the village, keeping a balance between native cultural
values and those borrowed from the West. Even those who then went
on to study abroad were not likely to abandon that perspective.317
The improvements in primary, secondary and seminary
education for Ruthenians and Ukrainians between the last two
decades of the nineteenth century and the two deèádes between the
world wars helped to train a clergy prepared to deal with the difficult
choices and challenges that faced them between 1900 and 1939.

Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's seminary reform in particular sought to
educate a new priesthood capable of evangelising the East as well as
regaining the lead in Ukrainian society. To what extent the Greek-
Catholic parish clergy accepted these tasks will be explored in
Chapters Six through Eight. First, however, it is necessary to
examine the social and economic context in which the newly
ordained priest found himself when he arrived at his first parish.
PART TWO: THE PRIEST IN SOCIETY
CHAPTER THREE: THE LEGAL, ECONOMIC
AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONTEXT
1. The Austrian Period
The Austrian Concordat and various ecclesiastical laws
governed the affairs of the Greek-Catholic Church in Galicia up to
1918 and to a certain extent under the Polish administration
thereafter.
Assignment to a Parish
After ordination, a priest would be assigned to his first parish.
In Peremyshl', the official eparchial journal listed parishes for
which a competition was to be held. 318 In order to be allowed to apply
for vacant benefices, priests had to pass periodic examinations in
theology. 319 Upon being assigned to a parish, a priest signed a
statement attesting that he was not indulging in simony. He also had
to make a formal confession of faith. Like all Catholic priests at the
time, he had to take an oath denouncing Modernism, the heresy of
modifying the Church's teaching to conform to the findings of
natural and historical science.320
A decree of the Austrian court chancery of 1786 provided for
the rights of a patron (colator) of a parish church to participate in the
selection of the parish priest. 321 Generally, the eparchial bishop
would nominate three candidates for a vacant benefice. The patron,
exercising the ius prezenty, would then choose one of the three. He
had to exercise this right within four months. 322 Typically, the
patron of a parish would be a local Polish landowner.

102
The state could also influence the choice of a priest for a given
benefice. Under the law of 7 May 1874, the state had thirty days to
object to an appointment. 323 If the state did not object, then the
candidate chosen by the patron (if any) would be canonically
instituted in the benefice by the bishop. He could not subsequently be
removed from the parish, except for good cause. If he became ill, an
assistant could be nominated, but the parish priest would retain the
ius ad rem or right to the benefice. If he died, an administrator
would be appointed temporarily in his place. The administrator
could be removed, and was obligated to pay rent to the consistory for
the parish lands.324
Salary (Congrua)
The financial basis for the Church under Austria was the
Religious Fund, established by decree in 1782 from the property of
dissolved monasteries; later, the Fund drew on other sources. There
was a separate Religious Fund for Galicia, managed by the civil
authorities. Benefice holders paid dues into the Fund, in proportion
to the estimated wealth of the benefice.325
In Austrian Galicia, parish priests received income from
various sources. The laws established a "congrual" system, intended
to secure a single basic salary for all priests. Each year, a priest
would submit an account of his fixed income from all sources
(including rents and sacramental fees), as well as of his expenses
(including taxes), to the civil authorities. If his net income did not
come up to the basic amount, the difference would be made up by a
supplement from the State Religious Fund. If it exceeded the basic
amount, the excess would be returned to the state. Under the law of
1898, the basic amount varied according to the size of the community;
assistant priests or vicars received a smaller amount. 326 Under a
of 13 September 1920 from the Greek-Catholic Metropolitan Consistory in L'viv,

during the period of Polish rule in Galicia as well.

law of 1907, after every five years of pastoral work the priest's income
would be raised by 100 crowns, up to forty years' service. Retirement
pay (under the 1898 law) was increased correspondingly up to the
amount of 2000 crowns. These increases would be paid out of the
Religious Fund, except to the extent that they were covered by the
priest's sacramental fees.327
Austrian law distinguished between church property and
benefice property. Under a law of 1874, the parochial or church
property was to be held by a local committee consisting of the parish
priest, the patron, and the representative of the community.328
However, because of the Galician bishops' failure to issue
appropriate instructions, the strict separation of church property
from benefice property was never effected in that province.
Nevertheless, the state did retain the right to examine the finances of
vacant benefices, to make inventories of property land income, and
generally to supervise the parish economy.329
The Austrian law of 7 May 1874 dealt among other things with
the troublesome matter of sacramental fees (iura stolae or Stol-Taxe).
The amounts of the fees for baptisms, weddings, funerals, and so on
had been regulated in Austrian Galicia at various times from the
late eighteenth century. 330 As will be seen below, they remained a
source of conflict between priest and parish to the end of the period
under study.
Despite the guarantees of Austrian law, some priests felt that
their general economic condition left much to be desired. In 1902 a
priest writing in a secular newspaper complained bitterly that the
consistory did not concern itself with the poverty of parish priests. "It
seems," he wrote, "that in the entire Catholic world there is no clergy
so helpless and neglected as our Ruthenian Catholic clergy, which in
addition is burdened by family obligations." 33' (The economic liability
of a married clergy would become a major argument of proponents of
compulsory priestly celibacy, discussed below and in Chapter Seven.)

of the Society of St. Andrew in L'viv in 1935, observed that before the
war, Greek-Catholic priests had been largely self-sufficient.332
The condition of the parish clergy was aggravated by the
military operations of World War I, which wrought economic ruin in
what was already one of Europe's poorest provinces. In 1918 the
episcopal ordinariat of the Peremyshi' eparchy collected reports of
the economic state of the parishes in various deaneries. The acting
dean of Mushyna reported that no parish in his deanery possessed
property worth over 20,000 crowns. In this mountainous region the
land, which was the priests' main source of income, was poor. War
losses reported by the parishes included confiscation of bells as well
as material damage to rectories. All but one of the 26 parish priests
had reported that they would not be able to survive if the state went
ahead with its planned nationalisation of 20-30% of their property.
Similarly, the dean at Sokal' reported that all his parishes had
suffered property damage during the war, in an average amount of
10% of the property's value. All but four of the eighteen parishes in
the Sambir deanery had suffered damage, and all required repairs or
new construction. All nine parishes of the Olkhivtsi deanery had
suffered war damage and required repairs, and none of the parish
priests received income up to the level of the state-guaranteed basic
amount. The dean of Iavoriv stated that despite the poor quality of the
land, which was sandy, all the priests' income was based on it, since
one could not count on the poverty-stricken parishioners for much
support. All 27 parishes received an income below the basic amount.
During the war, church and parish property had been damaged to
an average extent of 50% in all parishes. 333 As late as 1929, 41
churches in the Peremyshl' eparchy that had been destroyed, mostly
in the war, had not been rebuilt (compared to 1290 existing
churches).334
Church Administration
The Greek Catholic parish priest could count on visitations by
his dean and, more rarely, by his bishop and even the metropolitan.
In the Peremyshi' eparchy, deans were required to send reports of

their annual visitations to the Episcopal Ordinariat every
January. 335 Canonical visitations were the subject of a 1902 pastoral
letter of Metropolitan Andrei Sheptyts'kyi to the clergy of all three
eparchies. Promising to visit five parishes in each deanery, the
metropolitan warned that he could tell whether a parish priest had
prepared for the visitation only in the last few days, weeks or months.
He pointed out that both the material and the spiritual side of parish
work were important: chalices had to be gilded and vestments
cleaned, but at the same time the priest had to make sure that adults
as well as children really understood the faith. He would be able to
divine this from the confessions of the faithful that he would hear
during his visitation. In addition, he desired to hear a typical
sermon, and thus saw no need to designate the preacher far in
advance. The sermon would also serve to tell him much about the
quality of the pastoral work being carried out.336
In a 1905 pastoral letter to the clergy of the Stanyslaviv
eparchy, Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn informed them that during
visitations he would judge their work with primary attention to
sermons and catechesis. In particular, he would verify whether they
had made the faithful and the youth aware of the Church's basic
principles and given them an understanding of Christ in the
mystery of the Eucharist.337
Deans, too, conducted parish visitations. In the Peremyshl'
eparchy, a dean communicated his results to the episcopal consistory
on a prepared form. One such form printed in 1914 consisted of four
pages including questions on such matters as the pastor himself, the
condition of the church and other parish buildings, pastoral work
(with 23 questions to be asked of the parishioners), the state of parish
records, the treasury, and the teaching of religion in the local school.
A more elaborate and probably later form ran to 12 pages and
included additional questions on church brotherhoods and the
assistant priest, if any.338

In his pastoral letter of 1902 cited above, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi promised to try to attend a meeting of parish clergy in
every deanery. These meetings, known as soborchvky, were to be held
at the end of every canonical visitation. 339 The L'viv Archiepiscopal
Synod of 1897 had set down regulations on the holding of deanery
meetings. As adopted at the Peremyshi' Eparchial Council of 1898,
these rules required three such meetings to be held yearly in each
deanery, though a mission could be substituted for one of these. The
programme was to be decided by the dean, but one written and one
oral presentation must be given at each meeting, for the education of
the priests. The topics could be theological, pastoral, practical,
historical, etc., but political topics and those that might offend must
be avoided. The younger priests would be the first to give talks. The
official report of the Peremyshl' Council stressed the need for
continuing clerical education:
Truly, today more than ever the pastor cannot
stand in one place on the road of knowledge, but
as a representative of his lofty vocation, as a
teacher and leader of the people, absolutely must
progress constantly in the field of learning.. P340
The 1898 regulations were not universally heeded. Bishop
Konstantyn Chekhovych of Peremyshl' sent a circular to his deans
on 9 November 1905 complaining that some of them had not reported
the proceedings of their deanery meetings to the Episcopal
Ordinariat for years.341
Extraordinary deanery meetings were ordered by the
Peremyshl' episcopal ordinariat in 1912. The deans met in
Peremyshl' on 24 January, apparently to discuss priestly solidarity
and the danger of schism. Deans then sent circulars to their clergy
announcing the extraordinary deanery meetings, at which they
would read the bishops' joint pastoral letters of 13 February 1905 on
solidarity in pastoral work, of 11 January 1906 on conduct in public

life, and of 31 March 1910 on schism. Each parish priest would be
asked to report on the condition of his parish.342
Secular Administration
The parish priest's relations with the government and local
administration frequently involved his duty of keeping records of
births and deaths. At the meeting of the Komarno deanery on 7 May
1900, it was noted that the local authorities in Rudky had asked that
in military matters, parish offices should provide extracts from
parish records in the German language. A Fr. Onyshkevych moved
that the priests should continue to provide extracts in the Ruthenian
language, as provided by law, and if the authorities objected, they
should appeal the matter to the highest levels. The motion was
approved unanimously.343
The language of parish extracts and of the records themselves
became a bone of contention between the parish priest and the local
authorities, who in most cases were Polish. In 1912 Fr. A. Holinatyi
wrote in to the clerical journal Nyva relating his experiences with
the district court in Nove Selo. He noted that theretofore, parish
offices had received forms for death certificates in the Ruthenian
language. A few days earlier, however, Fr. Holinatyi had received
Polish-language forms. He returned them to the court, which
responded with a letter explaining that as a state record office, the
parish office must correspond with other authorities in the Polish
language. Fr. Holinatyi complained to Nyva that not all Ruthenian
priests were insisting on using their own language in such
instances. He suggested that if the Ruthenian language were indeed
disallowed in parish records, Ruthenian given names should be
written in Latin transcription -- but not Latin translation -- for
example, "Volodymyr" but not "Vladimirus." 344 As discussed below,
such technical matters would become the subjects of heated
controversy under Polish rule.

Under the Polish Republic, Austrian legislation remained in
effect until new laws were promulgated, but was never entirely
superseded. A decree of the Council of Ministers published on 25
March 1933 listed Austrian laws no longer in effect by virtue of their
inconsistency with the 1925 Polish Concordat; most of these
concerned property.345
The Polish Constitution of 1921 provided for freedom of
conscience and the equality of religious groups. However, the Roman
Catholic faith was first among equals, and the Church enjoyed
internal autonomy. These provisions were re-enacted in the
Constitution of 1935. The Concordat of 1925 gave the state authorities
only a minor influence on church affairs, allowing the Catholic
Church considerable freedom of action and internal administration.
Although Pilsudski's regime and its successors included many
secularising politicians who were far from pro-clerical, on the whole
the government honoured the provisions of both Constitution and
Concordat.346
The Concordat rendered the clergy immune from military
service, legal prosecution in the civil courts, and personal income
tax. It allowed them to conduct the religious education that was
compulsory in state schools. Their salaries were funded from the
property originally confiscated by the partitioning powers, which had
passed to the Polish government after 1918.
The Greek-Catholic bishops did not participate in the
preparatory work or negotiations for the Concordat, and the
Ukrainians in Poland were generally dissatisfied with the
document. 348 In the event, however, the Concordat was not fully put
into practice, as some differences between government and Church
remained unresolved.349
Article 19 re-established the ius praenotificationis, entitling
the government to object to the appointment of a priest to a benefice if

this should be contrary to state security. Under article 20, in such a
case the bishop would have three months to decide whether to
remove the priest. Should the bishop disagree with the government,
the case would be referred to a committee of two priests and two
representatives of the President. 350 In practice, the Greek-Catholic
bishops circumvented the government's right to object to an
appointment by nominating administrators or transferring priests
from parish to parish. In the 1920s, the L'viv governor was disturbed
by the government's inability to prevent the Greek-Catholic bishops
from transferring nationalist priests from small parishes to
politically significant ones. 351 However, according to one source, it
was generally accepted by the end of the inter-war period that the jj
praenotificationis applied to transfers as well as to appointments of
newly ordained priests. 352 In any case, the placement of Greek-
Catholic priests remained a constant source of tension between
Church and state, and confirmation was often refused or removal
demanded where the priest advocated separate status for the
Ukrainians .353
In the L'viv county (wojewddtw), once the patron had made
his selection from among the candidates proposed by the bishop, the
approval of the county would be sent to the Ministry of Religious
Cults. In the case of Fr. Hryhorii Fukan'chyk, whom the Bishop of
Peremyshi' sought to nominate to a parish in Uhertsi (Lisko district)
in 1933, the governor objected under article 19 of the Concordat
because during his tenure as administrator of that parish, Fr.
Fukan'chyk had "made himself known as an intractable foe of the
Polish State and People, and with his activity has made impossible
the peaceable co-existence of the population of both nationalities."
These assertions were based on detailed representations by the
district starostwa in Lisko. The circumstances were rather unusual,
since the patron had apparently lost possession of the property and
could not exercise the ius prezent y. The Bishop favoured Fr.
Fukan'chyk despite the fact that older priests -- who were allegedly

more loyal to Poland -- had applied for the benefice. Yet it appears
that the Minister of Cults did not find the evidence of Fr.
Fukan'chyk's anti-Polish activity sufficient to establish a threat to
state security, and declined to oppose the nomination. 354 In 1939 the
Apostolic Administrator for the Lemko region sought to install Fr.
Ivan Fenych, parish priest at Voikova in the Nowy Scz district, at
Senkova Volia in the Sianyk (Sanok) district. Passing information
from the administration at Nowy Scz about Fr. Fenych's Ukrainian
nationalist activity, his hostile attitude to the Polish state and his
previous troubles with the law to the Minister of Religious Cults, the
Cracow governor nevertheless stated that under the Ministry's
January 1929 guidelines for application of articles 19 and 20 of the
Concordat, he could not formally protest the priest's nomination to
the benefice. Indeed, the governors in Galicia in the late 1920s and
1930s interpreted the Concordat narrowly regarding threats to state
security, and protests against nominations of Greek-Catholic priests
to benefices were the exception, even in cases where the priest held
Ukrainian nationalist and anti-Polish views or belonged to the
Ukrainian National Democratic Union.355
Patronage
Article 21 of the Concordat, which was never put into effect,
provided that the matter of patronage rights would be regulated in a
separate agreement. The government regarded patronage as an
instrument of nationality policy. In practice, these rights were left as
they had been under the Partitions, except that the time within
which the patron must exercise his right was reduced to thirty
days.356
In Galicia, patronage did give the ordinarily Polish patrons a
certain amount of influence over parish appointments, though the
mechanics of the procedure did not allow them any real control. In
1920 a conflict arose between 34 patrons of parishes in the
Peremyshi' eparchy and the Greek-Catholic episcopal consistory.
The patrons, represented by a lawyer, accused the consistory of

proposing lists of candidates for benefices who it knew would be

that is Polish."357 The lawyer complained to the Council of Ministers,
the Ministry of Religious Cults and the provincial authorities that
the episcopal consistory was restricting patronage rights and
assigning benefices to priests who were decided enemies of po1sko6
and agitators schooled to struggle against Polish society. He added
that the consistory was preventing some priests from competing for
certain parishes, thus preventing the patrons from selecting priests
who had a peaceful, conciliatory attitude towards Polish society.
According to the lawyer, the Peremyshi' civic authorities asserted in
1921 that in assigning parishes, the episcopal consistory was
overlooking older, apolitical priests in favour of young candidates
imbued with hatred for polsko.358
In some cases, the patron was the county government. 359 This
presumably rendered objection under article 19 of the Concordat
redundant.
Landed Property
The Austrian laws on state supervision of church and parish
property, particularly the decree of 15 October 1858 and the law of 7
May 1874, remained in effect until the decree of the Council of
Ministers of 25 March 1933 declared them inconsistent with the
Concordat under article 25.360
The Concordat provided for state purchase of church property
under the planned land reform, leaving specified amounts to various
ecclesiastical persons and institutions. For priests, for example, from
15 to 30 hectares of property would be exempt from government
purchase and subsequent parcellation. However, the agrarian
reform, which in any case was slow in coming, never affected
church lands, as church and state continued their quibbling year

after year.36 ' In Galicia, where Church and clergy had some of their
largest landholdings, 362 this might have been resented. However,
since parcellation tended to favour Polish settlers rather than the
local Ukrainians, the Greek-Catholic bishops -- with the exception of
Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv -- avoided parcellation of
church and parish lands. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi introduced
parcellation in the L'viv archeparchy in the 1920s, but was persuaded
to abandon it. The government had neither the funds nor the
commitment to force parcellation, and the Latin-rite bishops were
not interested in carrying it through voluntarily. In fact, Bishop
Khomyshyn was the only bishop in Poland to carry out a full
parcellation. However, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi found another way
of aiding the poverty-stricken priests. Relying on his power under the
Concordat to create and provide materially for new parishes, he
divided existing parishes where there was a maternal and a filial
church, leaving the new parish under the same administrator. The
parish priest could thus receive an additional salary.363
The average size of benefice land of a Greek-Catholic parish
priest in the inter-war period was 52 hectares, compared to 33
hectares for a Latin-rite parish priest. In the L'viv metropolitan
province, the average Greek-Catholic benefice in 1927 measured 52
hectares, the average Latin-rite benefice 48 hectares. Typically, the
priest would rent out the land, though sometimes he would work it
himself.364
One source of friction among priests was the disproportion
among their landholdings. In 1927 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi took the
radical decision of limiting the size of a priest's benefice to 80
hectares. At 2 zloty per hectare per month, such a holding would
bring 160 zloty per month - together with income from other
sources, enough to support a priest and his family. Priests holding
over 80 hectares were obligated to turn over 2 zloty per hectare to the
curial treasury every month. The sums thus collected were then
distributed to priests who had under 80 hectares.365

Some friction seems to have occurred in the Peremyshi'
eparchy after the Concordat came into effect. Among the complaints
raised by some laymen against Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi in a brochure of
1929 was that before nominating a priest to a parish, he allegedly
demanded the income from a part of the parish property. The same
source alleged that in the Stanyslaviv eparchy, the income from an
apricot orchard belonging to a benefice was transferred to the
eparchial cathedral, and the income from a parish field that had
yielded oil was transferred to the episcopal ordinariat.366
Salary (Dotation)
After 1918, the Polish state paid priests the salary that they had
been receiving under Austrian administration. Various new laws
were proposed. A joint clerical-state commission proposed that the
basic clerical salary should be equal to that of civil servants, with
supplements for the high inflation of the time and for seniority. A
government plan was introduced in 1923, pending the conclusion of
the Concordat. The Concordat of 1925 left clerical salaries at the
same level as under the Partitions.367
From 1924, salaries were no longer paid by the state directly to
the priests. Instead, the state would pay the salaries ("dotations") for
the entire diocese to the bishop, who would then distribute them
among his clergy. This rule was retained under the Concordat. A
priest's income would depend on the size of his benefice lands.
However, the rules for clerical income spelled out in the Concordat
were never fully observed, causing some priests to complain. One
Greek-Catholic priest in the Stanyslaviv eparchy, for example,
received a salary despite the fact that he already had a 50-hectare
benefice; another, in the Peremyshi' eparchy, received a salary in
addition to the income from his 100 hectares of land.368
On the whole, however, the Greek-Catholic clergy found itself
impoverished in the wake of wartime destruction and financial
crisis. Its condition was also due in part to its dependence on the
impoverished general population for sacramental fees.369

In 1927, the Latin-rite clergy in the Lviv and Peremyshi'
dioceses received a somewhat higher total income than the Greek-
Catholic clergy of the corresponding eparchies. Although the Latin-
rite clergy of the L'viv metropolitan province received a lower total
income in that year than the Greek-Catholic clergy, the financial
needs of the latter, who in most cases were married, were
considerably greater. 37° Thus, although dividing the annual global
sums designated for the L'viv and Peremyshi' Latin-rite and Greek-
Catholic dioceses in 1933 by the number of clerical positions yields a
higher per capita salary for the Greek-Catholic priests,
considerations of family support (even in Peremyshi', where the
compulsory celibacy introduced in 1925 had only begun to have its
social effect) may modify or even reverse the implications of this
result.37'
The average Catholic priest's monthly salary in Poland in
1935-1936, about 102 or 103 zloty, can be compared to the 130 to 260
zloty earned monthly by 85% of teachers. The latter, however, were
ordinarily entirely dependent on their salaries for their support.372
The average monthly salary for a Greek-Catholic priest in the L'viv
archeparchy in 1933 was about 105 zloty, in the Peremyshi' eparchy
about 111 zloty, based on the calculation referred to in the preceding
paragraph. To this would have to be added his income from land and
other sources, as noted below.
In his negotiations with the Vatican representative
concerning the Concordat in January 1925, Professor Stanislaw
Grabski objected to the proposal that dotations should be paid in
global sums to the diocesan bishops, since certain "disloyal" bishops
might use their financial power to punish priests loyal to the Polish
state. It is clear from the discussion that Professor Grabski had in
mind the Ukrainian bishops, particularly Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi. 373 Certainly the government could control priests'
behaviour more effectively as long as it paid their salaries directly. In
1930, the Supreme Administrative Tribunal heard the case of Fr.
370     Wisocki 229-230, Table 44, p. 229.
371     This calculation is based on AAN, MWR i OP file 398. The yearly
salaries that it yields -- 1264 zloty for L'viv, 1332 zloty for Peremyshl' and 1293
for Stanyslaviv -- can be compared with the 1935-1936 average of 1233 zloty for all
Catholic clergy in Poland. Myslek 124.

Mykola Styslovs'kyi, who claimed back pay that had been withheld by
demand of the L'viv governor in 1924 from May of that year until 30
October 1925, when priests began to receive their salaries from their
bishops. Fr. Styslovs'kyi's salary had been docked apparently because
of his Ukrainian nationalistic activity.374
Once the payment of salaries was entrusted to the bishops,
however, the government sought to use its financial power to
influence them to control their potentially "disloyal" clergy. Thus, in
1934 the Stanyslaviv governor Jagodzirf ski supported the Greek-
Catholic Bishop Ivan Liatyshevs'kyi's request for placement in the
fifth salary category noting that the bishop had considerable
influence among his clergy and was helpful to him in "realising his
plans" regarding them. The government also gave direct material
benefits to priests supporting the Sanacja regime. 375 Greek-Catholic
priests' retirement salaries were manipulated in the same way, and
discrimination between priests of the two rites was practised. At the
same time, Greek-Catholic church authorities were also accused of
financial discrimination on political grounds. 376 For its part, the
government kept files on political activities of both Latin-rite and
Greek-Catholic priests.377
The bishops' control over salary naturally permitted abuses
unrelated to political considerations as well. In a 1926 letter to the
Pope complaining about their bishop's conduct, a group of forty
laymen of the Peremyshi' eparchy accused him of distributing
salaries arbitrarily, increasing or decreasing them depending on
whether he liked a given priest or whether that priest obeyed him.
They noted that under previous Austrian law, a priest was entitled to
an explanation of the amount of his salary and had a right of
appeal.378
Sacramental Fees
Sacramental fees or iura stolae were a source of both income
and controversy for the Greek-Catholic parish clergy. Under the
34    AAN, MWR j OP file 371, pp. 113-118. Since the Tribunal declined to
adjudge the case, it is not clear whether Fr.Styslovs'kyi ever received his back
pay.

Concordat, the government could agree with the bishops of Poland to
abolish the sacramental fees altogether, augmenting dotations by
way of compensation. No such agreement was ever reached. In 1928,
Greek-Catholic and Latin-rite priests charged the same rates in
L'viv county 1, but in Ternopil' county the Greek-Catholic clergy
charged higher fees and in Stanyslaviv county their fees were a
source of many conflicts with their faithful. A funeral could cost
anything from 10 zloty (L'viv county) to 400 (Stanyslaviv). There was
especially great variety in the amounts of the sacramental fees
charged in the Peremyshl' Greek-Catholic eparchy.379
Sacramental fees involved priests of both rites in conflicts with
parishioners, especially with regard to funerals. Some Church
circles denounced abuses. In 1932, Fr. Jan Zieja published a
brochure addressed to his fellow priests on this question; he himself
did not charge sacramental fees at all.380
Miscellaneous Income
Other sources of clerical income included state pay for
catechesis (350-1000 zloty annually), 38 ' fees for masses for special
intentions, 382 chancery fees (e.g. for issuing extracts from parish
records), 383 customary gifts from patrons (relatively rare after the
Austrian period), 384 oil leases, 385 and leases of parish land.386
Net Income
The average monthly net income of a Greek-Catholic parish
priest in Galicia around 1930 was 477 zloty in the L'viv archeparchy,
459 zloty in the Peremyshl' eparchy, and 591 zloty in the Stanyslaviv
eparchy. The corresponding figures for Latin-rite parish priests in

the L'viv and Peremyshi' dioceses (there was no Stanyslaviv diocese)
are considerably higher: 602 zloty and 608 zloty, respectively.387
An assistant priest (vicar) was paid by the parish priest out of
the parish treasury. Generally, the assistant was entitled to
maintenance, housing, and a monthly salary, the amount of which
could be decided by the eparchial curia. The assistant could also
receive a part of the income from services, depending on his
participation. 388 It was the custom, at least in the Peremyshl'
eparchy, for the assistant to receive one-third of the dotation, in
money or goods, and of the income from the land (except for orchard
and garden). However, he also had to pay a third of the tax. The
parish priest and his assistant could sign an agreement on the
division of income and expenses, to be confirmed by the episcopal
consi story.389
For purposes of comparison, Wislocki points out that the
average income of a Catholic parish priest was twice the average pay
of a civil servant who, unlike a Latin-rite priest (but like most Greek-
Catholic priests) had to support his family from this amount. The
contrast between a priest's income and that of his poorer peasant
parishioners, especially in the east and south of Poland, was
enormous. Wisocki also points out that although the state dotations
and contributions for masses were in standard amounts, other
elements of a priest's income varied considerably. Although the
dotation itself was low, the cost of living in village parishes was not
high.39°
General Economic Condition
However satisfacthry the salary of an average priest in Poland
might appear, the over-all economic condition of many members of
the Greek-Catholic clergy in Galicia was not enviable. In the
Stanyslaviv eparchy freshly ordained priests, who in the inter-war
period were usually peasants' sons, often found themselves in such
financial straits that they could not afford the journey to their first

parish. In many such cases, Bishop Khomyshyn would provide
financial aid. 39 ' In his Homiletical Lessons, which he sought to
publish in 1922, Fr. Teodor Savoika, parish priest in Selys'ky in the
Peremyshi' eparchy, complained that the Church and her servants
all too often were given donations grudgingly. He pointed out that the
hard household work which priests were forced to perform lowered
the intelligence, taking time away from necessary reading. Priestly
poverty, Fr. Savoika continued, could have important social
implications as well:
And have our communities ever considered
how, through their citizens' lack of benevolence,
and the poverty of the priest, his prestige, his
significance and power in the eyes of the world,
of governments and people of another rite,
another faith and another nationality must fall?
Behold: when in some Ukrainian community a
parish is funded for some persons of the Latin
rite, they try to see to it that the Latin-rite priest
should necessarily have more land -- at least a
few morgv more -- than does ours. Why? Because
everyone knows well that he who has more,
holds his head higher. No one ever got rich with
a skinny horse. And soon, very soon, a poor priest
