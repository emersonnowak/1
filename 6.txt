have been born around 1914, and attended primary school in the post-
war years into the mid-1920s, secondary school in the 1920s and early
1930s, and seminary in the middle and late 1930s. In this chapter we
shall therefore consider the changes in the Greek-Catholic clergy's
primary and secondary education that occurred between the
nineteenth century, particularly its last two decades, under Austrian
rule, and the first decade and a half of Polish rule in Galicia. We
shall concentrate, however, on the development of seminary
education between the 1890s and the 1930s.
1. PrimarySecondary Education
The problem of primary and secondary education for Galician
Ruthenians has been discussed in the Introduction. The period of
Polish autonomy in Galicia saw a flourishing of Polish-language
public education, but also saw the development of Ruthenian primary
and secondary schools. By 1910, there were 2,457 Ruthenian
(Ukrainian)-language primary schoo1s in the province, though these
were largely one- or two-room affairs. 125 By 1914, there were six
Ruthenian state g y mnasia; in addition, some 15 private educational
institutions of various sorts were set up by the Ruthenian
intelligentsia. 126 Among the latter were the schools organised by the
Ukrainian Pedagogical Association in L'viv. 127

With the collapse of Austria and the advent of Polish rule,
Ukrainian-language education encountered serious obstacles. In
1922 there were still 2,426 Ukrainian primary schools in Galicia,
with 2,247 Polish and 1,422 "utraquistic" (mixed) schools. 128 In 1925,
in the wake of the lex Grabski of the previous year, there were only
1,055 Ukrainian primary schools. 129 With clerical initiative and
support, the private organisation "Ridna Shkola" did succeed in
eventually founding 16 pre-schools and 41 primary schools, primarily
in the countryside; 130 thirty-one of the latter had been founded by
1928, along with 17 gvmnasia. 131 In 1930, however, there were only
four private Ukrainian gvmnasia, in addition to six state gvmnasia;
in the pacification of that year, Ukrainian secondary schools in L'viv,
Stanyslaviv, Rohatyn, Drohobych and Ternopil' were closed. 132
Although Ukrainian-language schools were established by the
government in areas of predominantly Ukrainian population, there
were schools with a Ukrainian majority where Polish was
nevertheless used as the language of instruction; however, the
teaching of the Ukrainian language was permitted. "Utraquistic"
schools, with some subjects taught in Polish and some in Ukrainian,
were established in areas of mixed population. 133
Under the Polish constitution of 1921, religious instruction was
compulsory in Polish state-supported schools for all under the age of
eighteen. Such instruction was conducted and controlled by religious
bodies, under the ultimate supervision of the state educational
authorities. 134 The Concordat of 1925 extended this requirement to
private schools enjoying the rights of public schools. 135 For Greek-
Catholics, religious instruction was conducted in Ukrainian, by the
designated Greek-Catholic catechist.

The need for secondary education preparatory to seminary
study was recognised by the Ruthenian Greek-Catholic Provincial
Synod of 1891, which provided in Title VIII, Chapter II of its Acts
Resolutions for the founding of minor seminaries. These were
intended to prepare boys for the seminary by way of thorough
secondary education and ascetic training. 136 In fact, the first minor
seminary was established only in 1919, in L'viv, under trying post-
war conditions. In the first decade of its existence it was merely a
hostel for pupils who attended state secondary schools. After the
pacification of 1930, and the attendant closing of several Ukrainian
schools, the minor seminary was re-organised as a full secondary
school, under the Dutch priest Jacob Perridon. Based on western
European models, the gymnasium began with the upper three forms
(sixth, seventh and eighth), adding the lower classes year by year
starting with 1931. A branch was established in Rohatyn. In 1932, the
Lviv minor seminary had 103 pupils, with 15 in the eighth form in
the Rohatyn branch. Although the minor seminary's matura was
not recognised by Polish universities, it sufficed for entrance not only
to the Greek-Catholic seminaries but also to Latin-rite Catholic
seminaries outside Poland and to the universities of Vienna, Prague,
Rome and Zagreb. A minor seminary was also established in
Stanyslaviv. 137
Monastic orders also recognised the need for both primary and
secondary private education in a Greek-Catholic and Ukrainian
spirit. To this end, the Basilian order founded schools in Buchach
and Dobromyl', while the newly-founded Eastern-rite Redemptorists
established a school in Holosko.
In the larger towns, primary and secondary-school pupils
from the countryside often lived in hostels operated by charitable
organisations. In the years before World War I, Russophile hostels
served to propagate their particular cultural and even political
orientation. To what extent, if any, these student hostels served to
educate future Greek-Catholic priests is difficult to ascertain. (The
Russophiles will be discussed in Chapter Six, Section 1.)
Some notion of secondary education in the Austrian state
schools at the turn of the century can be derived from a brief memoir

of the Rev. Myroslav Ripets'kyi. Born in Sambir in 1889, Ripets'kyi
completed the four-year primary school in that town and entered the
Archduchess Elisabeth gymnasium in 1899, completing the eight-
year course in 1907. In the 1904-1905 school year, he reports on the
basis of vmnasium records, there were 654 pupils, of which Poles
numbered 329, Ruthenians 201, Jews 115 and Germans 9. Most of the
pupils were from beyond the thwn of Sambir.
In the 1906-1907 school year, out of a thtal student body of 780
there were 532 Poles (including 134 Jews), and 248 Ruthenians. The
faculty consisted of 37 teachers. Ripets'kyi points out that despite the
ethnic heterogeneity of the pupils, there was no inter-ethnic hostility.
The gymnasium youth held a concert in honour of Adam Mickiewicz
in December 1906, and another for Taras Shevchenko the following
March. The school year opened with special masses in both the
Latin-rite and Greek-rite churches. 138
Religious instruction for Greek-Catholic pupils in Ripets'kyi's
gymnasium was conducted by the Rev. flarion Hmytryk, an "Old
Ruthenian" who made several pilgrimages to the Holy Land and
spoke "in proper Ukrainian, but with some Church-Slavonic
expressions" mixed in. In 1891 he had published, at his own cost, a
four-volume Greek-Catholic Lives of the Saints. 139
The young Ripets'kyi developed a love for literature during his
secondary school years, in part under the influence of the
subsequently prominent ethnographer Filaret Kolessa, who taught
Ukrainian literature there. In charge of the school's Ukrainian
library, "which was contained in two book-cases," Kolessa examined
each newly acquired book "and carefully crossed out every passage of
an anti-religious or immoral nature." Nevertheless, Ripets'kyi
recalls that he read nearly all the Ukrainian classics as well as
works of the contemporary literary circle "Moloda Muza," which
included Bohdan Lepkyi, Les' Martovych and Petro Karmans'kyi. He
also attended courses in Polish and German literature. 140
The Rev. Ripets'kyi's political education also dates to his
secondary school years. During the 1905 revolution in Russia, his
elder brother, a university student, took him to a clandestine meeting
138      Ripets'kyi, Myroslav. 'Spohady z molodykh lit" (photocopy of loose
article, publication unknown), 103-104, 110, 114.

of "Russian revolutionaries," which lasted late into the night.
Returning home at dawn in his street clothing, Ripets'kyi
encountered his mathematics teacher, who took no measures other
than to give him an unsatisfactory note at the end of the semester.
In his fourth year, the future priest also joined the local hromada,
founded in the 1860s and part of a network of clandestine Ukrainian
secondary-school student organisations. In the hromada. writes
Ripets'kyi, "the foundations of the Ukrainian world view were
formed, and gymnasium pupils learned to be loyal sons of their
native people and to prepare for the struggle with the enemies of the
Ukrainian nation." The Sambir hromada, he recalls, maintained ties
with similar organisations in Berezhany, Ternopil', Stryi,
Peremyshl' and L'viv. The hromada had its own library, which gave
the pupils access to books and journals not available in the school
library (and not subject to Professor Kolessa's censorious pen). The
young Ripets'kyi presented a number of talks at these secret
meetings, on subjects including the works of Pushkin and
Lermontov. He continued his contacts with the Sambir hromada even
as a seminarian in L'viv. 141
The future priest also engaged in legitimate extra-curricular
activities, joining the pupils' reading-room founded in November
1906. This organisation included both Poles and Ukrainians, and was
apparently modelled on the network of reading-rooms being set up
throughout the province for the education of the masses. Ripets'kyi
belonged to the Ukrainian section of the historical-literary circle (one
of five circles constituting the reading-room). Of the 65 members of
the Ukrainian section, 46 regularly read Literaturno-naukovyi
v istnyk ("Literary-scholarly Herald,") the foremost Ukrainian-
language journal of this type in Galicia. The members of this section
had access to the ideas of Ukrainian-orientated socialists such as
poet Ivan Franko and theoretician Mykhailo Drahomanov, and
Ukrainian writers such as Vasyl' Stefanyk. Ripets'kyi recalled that
the reading-room helped to develop its members' critical faculties,
"chiefly as a result of free discussion of the reading-room members'
talks." 142

56
Were Myroslav Ripets'kyi's secondary education and
experiences typical for Greek-Catholic priests ordained on the eve of
World War I, or more broadly in the preceding decade and a half? In
his memoir he mentions a few schoolmates who were later ordained,
143 but it would be difficult to ascertain the number of graduates of
the Sambir gymnasium who became Greek-Catholic priests. It is not
certain that the general tenor of the school had been the same a
decade and a half earlier, when future priests who would be ordained
at the beginning of the period under study would have attended, and
it is certain that after 1918 the character of the school changed.
Furthermore, the Sambir gymnasium was considered one of the
better state secondary schools in the province, and obviously differed
from private secondary schools in atmosphere if not in academic
level. Ripets'kyi's memoir only hints at Russophile activity, which at
other schools and in different social milieus would have been greater.
At the same time, a school of this size and importance, drawing
pupils from the surrounding region as well as from the district town
in which it was located, can reasonably be supposed to have educated
a fair number of future Greek-Catholic priests. In its academic and
extra-curricular programme it must have closely resembled other
state schools. Reading-rooms and hromadv were a common feature
of Ruthenian Galician life in the years before World War One. Thus,
the young Ripets'kyi's exposure to Ukrainian, Polish, German and
general European culture, his contact with Polish and Jewish pupils,
and his initiation into Ukrainian political activity were probably
fairly typical. They contributed to the attitudes and world-view or
"mentality" of the generation of Greek-Catholic priests who began
their pastoral activity in the last years of Habsburg rule.
The general decline, or at least arrested development, of
Ruthenian primary and secondary education in the wake of the
world war and the establishment of Polish rule in Galicia affected
the generation of priests ordained in the 1930s. The disruption caused
by the pacification of 1930, and the growing bitterness of Polish-
Ukrainian relations as well as nationalist activity among school
youth, further altered the general tenor of education during this
period. The Ukrainian graduates of a Polish state gymnasium or
private Ukrainian secondary school in 1932 had had very different

formative experiences from the graduates of an Austrian
Qvmnasium in 1892. 144
144 A Soviet author describing the L'viv minor seminary in the early 1930s,
possibly on the basis of the seminary archives, provides a striking detail. He
alleges that favourites of the institution's spiritual father, the Rev. Lev Hlynka,
were allowed to attend operettas and dances, while some of the pupils he
disfavoured lost their minds or committed suicide. Dobrychev, Volodymyr. IL
tini sviatoho liu, (2nd ed.), L'viv, 1970, 144. This vignette, of course, comports
with the standard marxist view of Church and bourgeois society with suspicious
neatness.

2. The Seminaries
However formative of character and general outlook one's
secondary-school experiences might have been, it was in the
seminary that one's priestly formation took place.' 45 In the Austrian
period, the bulk of Greek-Catholic seminarians attended the L'viv
seminary, taking their courses at the city's Emperor Francis
University. Ruthenian-language lectures in pastoral theology,
dogma, catechesis and methodology had been established at the
University in the 1840s. Life in the seminary was regulated by rules
set down in the acts of the 1891 Ruthenian Provincial Synod (Title
VIII, Chapter II, Annex XXXV), modelled on western European
seminary regulations and based generally on the decisions of the
Council of Trent. 146 The seminary in Peremyshi', founded in 1845,
provided only the fourth year of theological study for students who
had completed the first three years elsewhere -- normally at L'viv. 147
In 1896, the Peremyshi' seminary had three professors and 24
students in the fourth year (plus three at L'viv); in 1902 there were 18
fourth-year theology students. 148 A seminary was opened in
Stanyslaviv on 14 January 1907. 149
In 1919 the new Polish authorities terminated Ukrainian-
language theology lectures at the L'viv University (renamed after
King John Casimir), and dismissed the Revs. Halushchyns'kyi and
Myshkovs'kyi, who had refused to lecture in Polish or to swear an
oath of loyalty to the Polish state. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi then
established courses at the Greek-Catholic seminary, which around
1922 became the Archeparchial Theological Lyceum. In view of the

education during the 1930s in another Eastern Catholic rite, that of the

liquidation of Ukrainian chairs at the University, the restriction of
admission in August 1919 to Polish army veterans, and the closing of
the Ukrainian underground university in 1925, the faculty of
philosophy established at the seminary became a sort of ersatz
university for Galician Ukrainians. 150 Forty-four students entered
the seminary in 1920, and all but one were ordained. Fifty-six entered
in the following year, and the number increased almost every year
for the next several years. The over-all number of students was
between 150 and 200 in the first half of the 1920s.151
By 1915 the Peremyshl' seminary possessed an unfinished
seminary building, but military activity prompted the temporary
transfer of courses to I(romi in Moravia. On 13 December 1921, the
seminary building was dedicated. 152 By 1929, this seminary had nine
professors and 81 students; 153 in 1938 there were 110 students. 154
The 1925 Concordat permitted bishops to create private
confessional educational institutions, which would enjoy full
internal autonomy. 155 In 1928 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi reorganised
the L'viv seminary as a Greek-Catholic Theological Academy. By the
latter 1930s this institution had a student body of between 350 and 400
students in its five-year course of study, with 30 professors and
lecturers in the faculties of philosophy and theology. 156
In 1938 the Stanyslaviv seminary, which offered a four-year
course, was attended by 90 students. At the same time, four students
were being prepared for the Lemko Apostolic Administration

(created in 1934) at the Czçstochowa Seminary in Cracow, while
another attended the Byzantine-rite Pontifical Oriental Seminary in
Dubno. 157 Founded in 1928, the Dubno seminary was conducted by
Muscovite-rite Jesuits. Its 30 to 40 students, mostly Ukrainians, were
to work beyond Galicia, except for several designated for the Lemko
region. 158
3. The "Galician Monaco" and Seminary Reform
At the Ruthenian Provincial Synod held in L'viv in 1891, the
Apostolic Delegate, Archbishop Ciasca reportedly told Bishop Iuhian
Pelesh of Peremyshi' that he had been amazed by the knowledge and
intelligence of Greek-Catholic priests from even the most obscure,
inaccessible mountain villages. "All my priests are like that,"
proudly responded Bishop Pelesh. 159 Nevertheless, the Synod felt that
the seminary that was producing these priests was in need of reform,
and on 1 September 1901, in his first year as Metropolitan, Andrei
Sheptyts'kyi issued a pastoral letter to that effect. 160
What was wrong with the seminary? For one thing, the
seminarians' attitude left much to be desired. Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi criticised those who considered their room and board a
well-deserved gift, rather than the source of an obligation to their
Church and people. Such a seminarian, he noted, would become the
sort of priest who thinks that the people should feed him and work for
him -- precisely the sort of priest attacked in the Radical propaganda
of the time. The Metropolitan criticised those who played cards for
money in the seminary, for they, too, were motivated by an immoral
desire for gain without work. Others, he wrote, lived beyond their
means, incurring debts that they would later try to pay out of the
dowry of a marriage entered into for financial motives. He warned
that such candidates could be denied ordination. Laziness would not
be tolerated in the seminary; hard work must be motivated by faith
and piety. Indeed, work and piety are criteria of

61
a vocation, and those lacking the virtues necessary to become good
priests must be expelled, during the first year if possible. Another evil
that had to be eliminated was the strife and division among
seminarians caused by political loyalties. Intolerance of others'
political opinions, the metropolitan admonished, could seriously
harm a priest's pastoral work. Sheptyts'kyi also directed that the
duties of prefects should be better defined, and demanded a monthly
written report from the rector.161
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi was not alone in seeing the need for
seminary reform. Iaroslav Levyts'kyi, a L'viv seminarian writing in
May of 1901, applauded the reform then being considered by the
metropolitan. He felt that there was "excellent material" among the
Ruthenian theology students, whose increasing consciousness of the
