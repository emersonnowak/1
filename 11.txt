
It was not only in the Greek-Catholic Church that conflicts
occasionally arose between the lower clergy and their bishops. In
societies where the episcopate was drawn from the aristocracy,
differences were inevitable. The fact that bishops were drawn from
the monastic clergy added a further dimension to these differences,
in both the Eastern and the Western Church. 481 In the Greek-
Catholic Church, the Basilian monastic order had become the sole
source of bishops, though after the L'viv provincial synod of 1891 non-
monastic priests (such as Bishop Khomyshyn) could be consecrated
as well.
One way in which bishops differed from parish priests
was education (see Chapter One). Generally, future bishops were
sent abroad to study. Those who went to Innsbruck or Rome to be
educated by the Jesuits naturally came under western and
specifically Latin influences sometimes resented by the rank and file
clergy. When the students of the Ruthenian seminary in Rome were

Church, Pospielovsky attributes this conflict to the "learned" or "academic"
monasticism required of those aspiring to episcopal careers, a worldly
phenomenon borrowed in the seventeenth century from the Roman Catholic
Church by the Kiev Academy and having nothing to do with genuine
monasticism. Andrei Sheptyts'kyi referred to the hostility of priests towards
monks, who were accused of ambition, in his first pastoral letter as Bishop of

transferred in 1904 from the tutelage of the Jesuits to that of the
Basilians, the objection remained, for the Basilians (particularly
after their reform by the Jesuits in 1882) were known for their
latinising tendencies.482
The political role of the episcopate was another potential
source of friction with the lower clergy. The attempts of Metropolitan
Syl'vester Sembratovych (1885-1898) to find a political accommodation
with the Poles, which failed along with Barvins'kyi's "New Era,"
were opposed by the lower clergy, and created a gulf between priests
and bishop.483
In the joint pastoral letter of 1905 to the clergy, the three
eparchial bishops criticised the improper understanding of priestly
solidarity which pitted the clergy against their bishop. Too often
priests would fail to inform their bishop of their fellows' errors (after
reproaches in private and at a deanery meeting had failed). Yet they
accused the bishops of failing to solidarise with them. "You wish us
bishops to be in solidarity with you, but you do not consider yourselves
obligated to help us in that which is the most difficult part of our
duties in correcting those who are falling or who have fallen," they
wrote. Furthermore, there were priests who criticised "every step of
the bishop" in the press. "When enemies publicly attack us, there are
those among you who are glad of this!" 484 A Polish observer wrote in
1912 that the Greek-Catholic clergy were divided from, and hostile to,
their bishops.485 In his 1910 address before the Society of St. Paul the
Apostle in L'viv, Fr. losyf Botsian (who less than four years later
would be consecrated Bishop of Lutsk in a Kiev hotel room by his
fellow prisoner Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi) denounced the habit of
criticising the civic and even the church activity of one's bishop,
which on the part of intemperate priests would sometimes culminate
in a declaration of no confidence in him. Confidence in the bishop
and unity with him, said Fr. Botsian, was "the first and necessary
condition" for the unification of the clergy.486
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi sought to bring the eparchial clergy
closer to the episcopate, visiting the priests of the L'viv archeparchy

every summer beginning in 1902 and continuing, with interruptions,
until his illness prevented further travel in 1932. In this time,
according to Korolevskij, he managed to visit each deanery.487
Episcopal visitations were not always appreciated by the parish
priests. It did occur that during a visitation the priest would prevent
persons with a grievance against him from seeing the bishop. In
their 1905 pastoral letter the bishops pointed out that the parish
clergy should regard them as friends, not enemies. "Truly, the
behaviour of many towards us is at times so insincere that it would
appear that distrust of authority has become a general rule."488
The clergy had their own complaints against their bishops. As
suggested by the remarks of the pseudonymous pamphleteer of 1906
cited above, there was a feeling that the hierarchy was not doing
enough to protect the Church. Nor, in his opinion, did the bishops
protect their clergy from attacks by the laity and by the Polish
clergy.489
Writing in 1934, Henryk Ignacy Lubieiski attributed the
conflict between the Greek-Catholic bishops and clergy to the
persistent influence of Byzantine Orthodox tradition. In discipline,
he stated, Greek-rite priests differed greatly from Latin-rite clerics.
Historically, Greek-Catholic priests had often demonstrated hostility
to their bishops, such as to Metropolitan Sembratovych; now Bishop
Khomyshyn of Stanyslaviv was the victim. Most of the Greek-Catholic
clergy, even in his own eparchy, opposed his pronouncements. They
concurred, or at any rate silently acquiesced, in the campaign to
overturn his authority and to discredit him publicly. They brought
secular Ukrainian society into the fray, inspiring press campaigns
against their bishops. But the bishops themselves were not without
fault, noted Lubiettski; when the clergy of two eparchies signed a
petition protesting against a decision of the bishop of the third, their
bishops did not object.49°
The clergy, as represented by the editors of Nyva, defended
their right to dissent publicly from their bishops' orders. Surely, they
wrote in 1939, they were not obligated to agree to everything "like a

dumb herd." After all, the bishop's ideas were not infallible. In
matters that did not directly concern dogma or the bishop's
authority, it was permissible to express a different opinion in the
press. As long as they did not violate the general discipline of the
Church, the priests could advocate an ideology different from that of
their bishop. As for Bishop Khomyshyn's order forbidding his clergy
to read Nyva -- the point of departure of this editorial -- it was
unheard of that one bishop should forbid his clergy to read a
publication that was published by permission of another.49'
Despite the controversies over celibacy, participation in secular
organisations and Nyva, Bishop Khomyshyn appears to have had
close and cordial relations with his clergy. Fr. Roman Lobodych
(ordained in 1917), rector of the Stanyslaviv cathedral from 1930 to
1935, recalls that the bishop frequently visited his priests,
particularly those who were ill or in prison, and helped them
financially. Although he opposed a married clergy, he placed
married priests from the other two eparchies in wealthier parishes
near towns, so that they could support their families and send their
children to school. He also cared for deceased priests' widows and
orphans. As a result, writes Fr. Lobodych, the Stanyslaviv eparchial
clergy were especially respectftil and obedient.492
While the attacks against Bishop Khomyshyn may indeed have
come primarily from the other eparchies, in the 1920s Bishop
Kotsylovs'kyi faced a virtual rebellion by his own eparchial clergy. He
was attacked by both priests and laymen for alleged misconduct in a
variety of matters: the introduction of compulsory celibacy,
administrative abuses (particularly his conflicts with the cathedral
chapter), eparchial finances, the events leading to his removal from
the patronage of the Institute for Girls in Peremyshi', and abuses
regarding an orphanage in that town. 493 The bishop was also
accused of tactless conduct towards the clergy, notably when at the
ceremony of the coronation of an icon of the Mother of God in Sambir
on 27 August 1928, he reportedly interrupted a sermon of Fr. Symeon
Kul'chyts'kyi, loudly commanding him to "climb down" from the
pulpit.494

Clerical collusion in the lay attacks on Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi is
alleged in the 1927 reply to the bill of complaints of the Peremyshi'
secular intelligentsia (actually addressed to the Pro-Nuncio in
Warsaw) by Luigi Cardinal Sincero, Secretary of the Sacred
Congregation for the Eastern Church. In this reply, Cardinal
Sincero spoke of "some sort of ill-concealed understanding or
conspiracy between some priests and laymen, aimed at causing the
removal of their own Bishop-Ordinary from his see -- which is
clearly apparent from the complaint itself."495
However, not the entire clergy of the Peremyshi' eparchy was
ranged against their bishop. At a secret meeting held in Peremyshi'
on 24 November 1926, 46 priests signed six resolutions in defence of
Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi. Among them were resolutions censuring the
"systemetic press attacks against bishops," and calling on the clergy
to defend them. They also decided to send a telegram of support to
Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi, and to support church publications such as
Bishop Khomyshyn's "Nova Zoria." It may be significant that the
apparent initiators of the meeting, and many if not most of the
signatories to the resolutions, were deans or other higher clergy.496

CHAPTER FIVE: CLERGY AND LAITY
It seems that there is no other state in human
society that would have such a varied fate as the
clerical state. On the one hand, high honour
amongst the people, esteem even from strangers
because of our clerical garb alone, but on the
other hand disdain and hatred from elements
hostile to the Church, and vexation from the
Radical and socialist press. Just as honour for
the priest for the lofty mission which he is
fulfilling amongst the people, and for his high
office, is completely natural, so hostility and
hatred towards the clergy cannot at all be
justified.497
Thus wrote Fr. Iuliian Dzerovych in the clerical journal Nyva
in 1912. His words may recall the complaint of Iaroslav Levyts'kyi
about public perceptions of L'viv seminarians made in 1901, and
quoted in the first chapter. Unlike seminarians, however, ordained
parish priests lived their entire lives in the midst of civil society. They
encountered the laity on a daily basis and to an extent were
dependent on them for support. The Greek-Catholic parish clergy's
relations with their parishioners in town and country, both in the
pastoral setting and beyond it, are the subject of this chapter.
1. Pastoral Work
In a province with as high a birth-rate as Galicia, one would
expect that adequate pastoral care would have required a growth in
the number of priests. The over-all number of Greek-Catholic priests
did in fact grow during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
century. 498 In inter-war Poland, the ratio of priests of all rites to
faithful improved, and between 1934 and 1937, the number of Catholic
diocesan priests of all rites grew by However, it appears that
the number of Greek-Catholic parish priests remained fairly
constant between 1900 and 1939. According to one source, there were
2,483 Greek-Catholic priests distributed over 1,875 parishes in "Little

Poland" in 1914.500 Fr. Tadeusz 1iwa states, however, that
"immediately before World War I" there were 2,478 Greek-Catholic
priests in the province, of whom 2,235 were parish priests. 50 ' A
government source indicated in 1935 that there were 2,198 Greek-
Catholic secular priests in Poland, with 1,854 parishes. 502 In 1938-
1939 there were 2,284 Greek-Catholic priests in Poland, with 2,491
parishes.503 liwa counts 2,232 Greek-Catholic parish priests in 1937-
1938.° Accepting his figures as true, it would appear that the
number of Greek-Catholic parish priests was remarkably static
throughout most of the period under study. 1iwa remarks, however,
that after the first world war the number of priests diminished, to be
replaced subsequently by younger priests of a different ideological
persuasion. 505 Thus, quantitative stability may disguise qualitative
change.
Yet as mentioned in the previous chapter, the density of the
network of Greek-Catholic parishes and churches in relation to the
population was considered to be greater than that of the Latin rite,
giving the former an advantage in pastoral competition. According to
a 1929 report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in L'viv county the
Latin-rite population was somewhat larger than the Greek-rite
population (1,284,000 as against 1,141,000), but the number of Latin-
rite parishes was much smaller than that of Greek-rite parishes: 386
as compared with 697. Also, there were 39 Latin-rite churches and
chapels in the county as against 113 Greek-rite churches and
chapels.506 (It must be remembered, however, that the large Polish
population was heavily concentrated in the city of L'viv, where the
Latin-rite churches could be visited by Roman Catholics more easily

than if they had been in the less densely populated countryside.) In
1914 there were 1,854 Greek-Catholic parishes in Poland; in 1938,
1,970.°
It would follow that in Galicia, Greek-Catholic parishes had
smaller populations than Latin-rite parishes, resulting in greater
availability of pastoral care. This is confirmed by comparing the
figures cited further in this paragraph with the average number of
faithful per Latin-rite parish in Galicia around 1910, which was
4,362. 508 However, the average Greek-Catholic parish population
grew in two of the three Galician eparchies. Before World War I, the
average number of faithful per Greek-Catholic parish was 1,773 in
the L'viv archeparchy, 1,749 in the Peremyshl' eparchy, and 2,343 in
the Stanyslaviv eparchy. Before World War II the corresponding
numbers were 1,067.62, 1,982.17, and 2,484.54. Yet Fr. liwa's
figures would yield an over-all average of about 1,983 Greek-Catholic
faithful per parish in 1914, and only about 1,927 in 1938. While these
figures indicate greater availability of pastoral care for the Greek-
Catholics, the concentration of the Polish population and of Latin-rite
churches in the towns and cities would have enhanced the apparent
availability of pastoral care for the Latin rite somewhat.
More relevant to the question of pastoral care, however, is the
number of faithful per parish priest. On the basis of Fr. liwa's
figures, 51 ° in 1914 there were on the average about 1,645 Greek-
Catholic faithful per parish priest, rising to about 1,700 in the late
1930s (though an alternative figure cited by liwa would yield 1,495).
This would confirm the expectation that given a fairly constant
number of parish priests and a rising population, the ratio of priests
to faithful would have deteriorated somewhat.
Some notion of parishioners' access to their priest is given by
figures on the number of parishes consisting of more than one
village. In the Peremyshl' Greek-Catholic eparchy in 1928, for
example, out of 688 parishes only 189 consisted of one village, while
499 included more than one village. In the Stanyslaviv eparchy in
1925, out of 417 parishes only 196 were limited to a single village,

while 221 comprised more than one village. 51 ' The distances that a
priest had to travel to reach his faithful were aggravated by the
mountainous terrain in parts of the Stanyslaviv and Peremyshi'
eparchies. The unavailability of a Greek-Catholic priest was an
invitation for transfers to the Latin rite or even conversions to
Orthodoxy.512
At least as important as the availability of pastoral care was its
quality. In 1901, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi called on the clergy of the
metropolitan province to cultivate a spirit of sacrifice, going beyond
their obligations to engage in social and cultural work, so as to bridge
the social gap that separated the clergy from the people. Priests must
help the people educate themselves and improve their material life.
At the same time, they must double their efforts to teach the Gospel;
otherwise, he warned, the economic and educational movement
would turn against them and the Church. 513
The Greek-Catholic bishops were evidently not satisfied with
the general level of pastoral care. In their joint pastoral letter of 1905
on priestly solidarity, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and his fellow
bishops indicated some of the typical failings of the parish clergy:
neglect of preaching and catechesis, malicious gossip, failure to see
to it that their families and servants attended liturgy on Sundays and
holidays, a lack of reverence at the altar, incomplete or careless
recitation of sacramental formulae, hasty confessions, hurried
celebration of the liturgy.514
About six months later, Bishop Khomyshyn bluntly told his
clergy that they had been taken unawares by the various anti-
Christian currents of the day, mostly because of deficient preparation
in the seminary. Their pastoral work was inadequate: "In sermons --
banality and longwindedness, in confession of the faithful a
deficiency of spiritual guidance, in church singing a noisy
barbarism, in ritual a lack of taste and a chaotic disunity, and in
many churches a lack of aesthetics, dirt and neglect, which all
combine to repel the faithful rather than to attract them." He

reminded his priests that in order to be able to influence their flocks,
they must first educate themselves. They must learn to preach
plainly and effectively, stressing Catholic and not simply "Christian"
teaching. In particular, Bishop Khomyshyn prescribed steps for
sounder catechesis. 515 In a pastoral letter addressed to his eparchial
clergy six years later, in 1911, Bishop Khomyshyn mentioned their
pastoral work among the positive recent developments in what were
generally evil times for the Church.516
A major problem in pastoral activity before World War One
was the threat of Orthodox conversions. Russophiles and proponents
of Orthodoxy had found compelling arguments for their cause in the
frequent conversions of Greek-Catholics to the Latin rite, mentioned
above. In 1912 Fr. E. Krynyts'kyi, parish priest at Bobiatyn, wrote to
the Peremyshi' episcopal ordinariat that priests should sign public
protests against the schism, and appeal to the public authorities to
defend the Greek-Catholic Church by banning "Russian spies and
agitators" and their periodicals and organisations. He also called for
priestly solidarity, and the splitting of some of the overly extensive
deaneries to ensure better control.517
In addition to the effects of general devastation, pastoral work
was impeded in the wake of the world war because of the arrest and
deportation of a large number of Greek-Catholic priests, and the
flight of others (see Chapter Six). Some also died of typhus. This left
many of the remaining priests in charge of several parishes.518
In the inter-war period, Catholic pastoral work throughout
Poland aimed at (1) deepening religious life, (2) forming a defensive
and an offensive attitude towards groups advocating a world view
hostile to Catholicism, (3) solving the social question, (4) raising the
level of culture and education, and (5) providing a civic-patriotic
education. A prime means of defending the Church's positions and
increasing its social influence was the "apostolate of the laity."

Catholic priests were heavily involved in helping to organise various
lay societies, such as the Apostolate of Prayer, Marian Sodalities, and
Catholic Action. 519 Much of this involved social and political issues,
so that it was difficult to distinguish pastoral from socio-political
activity. 520 A significant portion of the parish clergy in the
countryside, however, reacted with passive resistance to these
organisational novelties, which disrupted the traditional style of
pastoral work.52'
The pastoral activity of the Greek-Catholic clergy was on the
whole similar to that of the Latin-rite priests. They followed Latin
models of spiritual life, and like their Polish fellow-priests
experienced a revival of pastoral work in the 1930s. Among the
organisations they helped form was the Brotherhood of the Most Holy
Sacrament in L'viv, and the Apostolate of Prayer; the latter existed in
over half the parishes of the Stanyslaviv eparchy. Church
brotherhoods and temperance societies were also common.522
The Apostolate of Prayer, founded in southern France in 1844,
had reached Polish lands in 1871. It was strongest in the Austrian
partition, existing in almost every parish. In the 1930s the Apostolate
experienced a rapid development, counting some 750,000 members
throughout Poland in 1936. It was directed by the Jesuits. In each
diocese, the Apostolate was under the jurisdiction of the bishop-
ordinary, who appointed a diocesan director. On the parish level, it
was the parish priest who supervised its activity. The devotional
practices were simple, focusing on offering oneself to the Heart of
Jesus. However, the concept of dedicating one's entire life and
activity to Christ, combined with monthly intentions prescribed in
Rome, sometimes involved members in social and political issues;
thus, in March 1933 the Apostolate opposed communism and
plutocracy, in October 1936 it assailed Freemasonry, and in February
1938 it denounced Godless communism. The Apostolate of Prayer
has been described as a means for the clericalisation of social life,

and the clergy have been accused of using such devotional groups to
mobilise religious feelings for political aims.523
The Greek-Catholic Church devoted much attention to the use
of lay organisations in pastoral work. 524 Brotherhoods, which
enjoyed a venerable tradition in the East Slavic lands, continued to
play a major part in parish life. Of the modern types of lay
organisations, Catholic Action aroused considerable interest in the
1930s, though it is difficult to determine how much practical work
was actually achieved. Created in 1905 by Pope Pius X and
encouraged by Pope Pius XI, the movement represented an attempt
by the Church to break out of its isolation in response to the moral
and spiritual ruin of Europe. In September 1930 Cardinal illond
introduced Catholic Action into Poland, and a conference of bishops
meeting in L'viv in January of the following year established a
statute for the organisation in Galicia. The Polish branch of Catholic
Action was re-organised in 1934, and by 1936 claimed 519,666
members throughout Poland, mostly in the countryside. The basic
principle of Catholic Action was the cooperation of the laity with the
Church in apostolic work. While avowedly apolitical, or rather
suprapolitical, the movement aimed to increase the influence of
Christian morality on political life. 525 In a joint pastoral letter to the
clergy and laity, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and three of the Galician
bishops recommended Catholic Action as a means to save the
faithful from moral and spiritual ruin. 526 The Greek-Catholic clergy
apparently regarded the movement as a way to increase the
Church's influence in a society dominated by political parties. While
the movement transcended social and political divisions within
Ukrainian society, the Greek-Catholic variant of Catholic Action
developed independently of the Polish movement. The anti-
communist and nationalist stance of the Greek-Catholic variant
attracted the secular Ukrainian intelligentsia to what was in
principle a form of the lay apostolate. However, in a letter of October

1931 to Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, Fr. Roman Berest wrote that there
was a lack of qualified laymen, which would force the clergy to do
most of the work. Unfortunately, the clergy itself lacked enthusiasm
and organisational ability.527
In the Peremyshl' eparchy, an attempt was made to remedy
this problem. Articles were published about the Catholic Action
movement, 528 and a pastoral course on Catholic Action was held in
Peremyshl' on 4-7 September 1934. Each deanery was to send two
priests to this course, and over 115 attended. A variety of pastoral
topics was covered by nine speakers during the three-day course.529
Greek-Catholic priests in Galicia recognised that they had to
go beyond the church and the rectory in order to have sufficient
contact with the faithful. For example, in 1928 Fr. losyf Marynovych
suggested at a meeting of Peremyshl' Eparchial Aid (a priests'
society) that other points of contact such as the school, the reading-
room, and the village cooperative should be utilised. 53 ° The meeting
decided that new pastoral methods should be discussed at deanery
meetings, that model sermons should be printed in the eparchial
bulletin and homiletic handbooks disseminated, and that the
Apostolate of Prayer should be propagated. Priests should also work
in reading-rooms and cooperatives and try to draw the intelligentsia
into activity beneficial to Church and people. 53 ' Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi,
who attended this meeting, favoured the introduction of modern
pastoral methods, and established Catholic Action in his eparchy in
1931. He also stressed the importance of the press, dedicating three or
four pastoral letters to this topic.532
In the mid-1930s the Greek-Catholic bishops called on their
clergy as well as the faithful to prepare for a struggle against the

"enemies of God" who were infiltrating social organisations and
threatening the faith. They recommended that priests and laity work
together in Catholic Action to avert the danger. 533 Yet in 1935 Fr.
Vasyl' Pryshliak, while recognising that the new "religious
offensive" would require "a new attitude of spirit, new tactics, new
armament and training" -- and a new pastoral and theological
approach -- lamented the fact that in their pastoral work, most of the
Greek-Catholic clergy had not gone beyond academic manuals and
were not interested in developing their activity in a contemporary
spirit. Catholic Action was not widely understood, and the clergy
remained in a state of incomprehensible calm, indifference, or
complacency. 534 Similar sentiments were expressed anonymously in
Nyva by a 70-year-old priest in 1934. Many priests had become
indifferent, apathetic. Their formalistic style of work resembled that
of bureaucrats, and they were not accessible to their faithful. More
active priests, on the other hand, often proved ineffective because in
the seminary they had not been prepared for practical work. This
was particularly true in Peremyshi' and Stanyslaviv. The new
German pastoral methods meant nothing to them. Meanwhile, in
the West priests were being re-educated through special pastoral
courses. Furthermore, the Greek-Catholic clergy were also falling
behind their Polish neighbours in this respect. He suggested that
rather than waiting for their superiors to remedy the situation, the
priests themselves should draw up a plan for their continuing
pastoral education. "Let us not allow the enemy to prevail with
modern weapons!"535
The need for modern pastoral methods was felt by Fr. Stefan
Hrynevets'kyi, speaking at the Iaroslav (Jaroslaw) deanery meeting
on 23 May 1939 on "The Obligations of the Pastor at the Present
Time." The priest must set an example by living a holy life, but he
must also develop his knowledge, both theological and secular. As in
the past, the Church must prove that all human knowledge can
serve to explain and defend the Catholic faith. The most important
condition of effective pastoral work, however, was familiarity with

the parish itself -- with the people, their character, their world view.
In addition to maintaining contact with parishioners through social
orgnisations, Fr. Hrynevets'kyi recommended maintaining a file of
parish statistics. This would also help him in conducting pastoral
work in the home, a technique proved effective in the West. 536 Fr. D.
Kuzmins'kyi, speaking at the Sambir deanery meeting in May of the
same year, suggested that in addition to prayer, example, and work
in religious societies, priests should obtain motion picture projectors
and tour the villages with Christian films on moral and religious
topics .537
Faced with a moral decline which they attributed to the world
war, and with social, ideological and sectarian threats to the faith,
Greek-Catholic priests of the 1930s continued to seek more effective
pastoral methods. 538 A common means to foster their flocks'
spiritual development was to organise missions by visiting monastic
preachers, typically Basilians or Redemptorists. To further the
