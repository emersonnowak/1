in Vienna, positively affected our seminarians'
change of world view. They saw how our
intelligentsia in general had accepted western
civilisation, but only that civilisation that was
far from the fundamentals of Christ's teaching;
they were aware that such culture brings ruin
and not good for our society. In such
circumstances, the young theologians
understood that above all, it must adopt Catholic
religious ideas from the West and with them, to
colour the national and social aspects of our
people's life, and thus to react against the dark
forces of growing faithlessness.315
The secessionists were, however, a special case. In 1916 a
priest writing in Nyva criticised candidates returning from
foreignstudies. They may be pious and learned, he concedes, but they
make poor pastors and teachers of the people. For in the West, they
have become alienated from their Church and from their people's
rites and customs -- indeed, from the people themselves. They have
no regard for those things "that every sincere Ukrainian treasures."
Although they may obtain high positions in the church hierarchy,
they cannot influence the people bIuse they have become estranged
from them and from their culture.316
This last observation illustrates some of the dangers of overly
rapid assimilation of foreign cultural values, and foreshadows the
conflicts of the inter-war period. In these conflicts, parish priests
sometimes found common cause with the laity in criticising the
policies of their foreign-educated bishops. The parish clergy were
nearly all trained in the three Galician seminaries, where they could
benefit from the improvements in education while maintaining their
ties with the village, keeping a balance between native cultural
values and those borrowed from the West. Even those who then went
on to study abroad were not likely to abandon that perspective.317
The improvements in primary, secondary and seminary
education for Ruthenians and Ukrainians between the last two
decades of the nineteenth century and the two deèádes between the
world wars helped to train a clergy prepared to deal with the difficult
choices and challenges that faced them between 1900 and 1939.

Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi's seminary reform in particular sought to
educate a new priesthood capable of evangelising the East as well as
regaining the lead in Ukrainian society. To what extent the Greek-
Catholic parish clergy accepted these tasks will be explored in
Chapters Six through Eight. First, however, it is necessary to
examine the social and economic context in which the newly
ordained priest found himself when he arrived at his first parish.
PART TWO: THE PRIEST IN SOCIETY
CHAPTER THREE: THE LEGAL, ECONOMIC
AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONTEXT
1. The Austrian Period
The Austrian Concordat and various ecclesiastical laws
governed the affairs of the Greek-Catholic Church in Galicia up to
1918 and to a certain extent under the Polish administration
thereafter.
Assignment to a Parish
After ordination, a priest would be assigned to his first parish.
In Peremyshl', the official eparchial journal listed parishes for
which a competition was to be held. 318 In order to be allowed to apply
for vacant benefices, priests had to pass periodic examinations in
theology. 319 Upon being assigned to a parish, a priest signed a
statement attesting that he was not indulging in simony. He also had
to make a formal confession of faith. Like all Catholic priests at the
time, he had to take an oath denouncing Modernism, the heresy of
modifying the Church's teaching to conform to the findings of
natural and historical science.320
A decree of the Austrian court chancery of 1786 provided for
the rights of a patron (colator) of a parish church to participate in the
selection of the parish priest. 321 Generally, the eparchial bishop
would nominate three candidates for a vacant benefice. The patron,
exercising the ius prezenty, would then choose one of the three. He
had to exercise this right within four months. 322 Typically, the
patron of a parish would be a local Polish landowner.

102
The state could also influence the choice of a priest for a given
benefice. Under the law of 7 May 1874, the state had thirty days to
object to an appointment. 323 If the state did not object, then the
candidate chosen by the patron (if any) would be canonically
instituted in the benefice by the bishop. He could not subsequently be
removed from the parish, except for good cause. If he became ill, an
assistant could be nominated, but the parish priest would retain the
ius ad rem or right to the benefice. If he died, an administrator
would be appointed temporarily in his place. The administrator
could be removed, and was obligated to pay rent to the consistory for
the parish lands.324
Salary (Congrua)
The financial basis for the Church under Austria was the
Religious Fund, established by decree in 1782 from the property of
dissolved monasteries; later, the Fund drew on other sources. There
was a separate Religious Fund for Galicia, managed by the civil
authorities. Benefice holders paid dues into the Fund, in proportion
to the estimated wealth of the benefice.325
In Austrian Galicia, parish priests received income from
various sources. The laws established a "congrual" system, intended
to secure a single basic salary for all priests. Each year, a priest
would submit an account of his fixed income from all sources
(including rents and sacramental fees), as well as of his expenses
(including taxes), to the civil authorities. If his net income did not
come up to the basic amount, the difference would be made up by a
supplement from the State Religious Fund. If it exceeded the basic
amount, the excess would be returned to the state. Under the law of
1898, the basic amount varied according to the size of the community;
assistant priests or vicars received a smaller amount. 326 Under a
of 13 September 1920 from the Greek-Catholic Metropolitan Consistory in L'viv,

law of 1907, after every five years of pastoral work the priest's income
would be raised by 100 crowns, up to forty years' service. Retirement
pay (under the 1898 law) was increased correspondingly up to the
amount of 2000 crowns. These increases would be paid out of the
Religious Fund, except to the extent that they were covered by the
priest's sacramental fees.327
Austrian law distinguished between church property and
benefice property. Under a law of 1874, the parochial or church
property was to be held by a local committee consisting of the parish
priest, the patron, and the representative of the community.328
However, because of the Galician bishops' failure to issue
appropriate instructions, the strict separation of church property
from benefice property was never effected in that province.
Nevertheless, the state did retain the right to examine the finances of
vacant benefices, to make inventories of property land income, and
generally to supervise the parish economy.329
The Austrian law of 7 May 1874 dealt among other things with
the troublesome matter of sacramental fees (iura stolae or Stol-Taxe).
The amounts of the fees for baptisms, weddings, funerals, and so on
had been regulated in Austrian Galicia at various times from the
late eighteenth century. 330 As will be seen below, they remained a
source of conflict between priest and parish to the end of the period
under study.
Despite the guarantees of Austrian law, some priests felt that
their general economic condition left much to be desired. In 1902 a
priest writing in a secular newspaper complained bitterly that the
consistory did not concern itself with the poverty of parish priests. "It
seems," he wrote, "that in the entire Catholic world there is no clergy
so helpless and neglected as our Ruthenian Catholic clergy, which in
addition is burdened by family obligations." 33' (The economic liability
of a married clergy would become a major argument of proponents of
compulsory priestly celibacy, discussed below and in Chapter Seven.)

of the Society of St. Andrew in L'viv in 1935, observed that before the
war, Greek-Catholic priests had been largely self-sufficient.332
The condition of the parish clergy was aggravated by the
military operations of World War I, which wrought economic ruin in
what was already one of Europe's poorest provinces. In 1918 the
episcopal ordinariat of the Peremyshi' eparchy collected reports of
the economic state of the parishes in various deaneries. The acting
dean of Mushyna reported that no parish in his deanery possessed
property worth over 20,000 crowns. In this mountainous region the
land, which was the priests' main source of income, was poor. War
losses reported by the parishes included confiscation of bells as well
as material damage to rectories. All but one of the 26 parish priests
had reported that they would not be able to survive if the state went
ahead with its planned nationalisation of 20-30% of their property.
Similarly, the dean at Sokal' reported that all his parishes had
suffered property damage during the war, in an average amount of
10% of the property's value. All but four of the eighteen parishes in
the Sambir deanery had suffered damage, and all required repairs or
new construction. All nine parishes of the Olkhivtsi deanery had
suffered war damage and required repairs, and none of the parish
priests received income up to the level of the state-guaranteed basic
amount. The dean of Iavoriv stated that despite the poor quality of the
land, which was sandy, all the priests' income was based on it, since
one could not count on the poverty-stricken parishioners for much
support. All 27 parishes received an income below the basic amount.
During the war, church and parish property had been damaged to
an average extent of 50% in all parishes. 333 As late as 1929, 41
churches in the Peremyshl' eparchy that had been destroyed, mostly
in the war, had not been rebuilt (compared to 1290 existing
churches).334
Church Administration
The Greek Catholic parish priest could count on visitations by
his dean and, more rarely, by his bishop and even the metropolitan.
In the Peremyshi' eparchy, deans were required to send reports of

their annual visitations to the Episcopal Ordinariat every
January. 335 Canonical visitations were the subject of a 1902 pastoral
letter of Metropolitan Andrei Sheptyts'kyi to the clergy of all three
eparchies. Promising to visit five parishes in each deanery, the
metropolitan warned that he could tell whether a parish priest had
prepared for the visitation only in the last few days, weeks or months.
He pointed out that both the material and the spiritual side of parish
work were important: chalices had to be gilded and vestments
cleaned, but at the same time the priest had to make sure that adults
as well as children really understood the faith. He would be able to
divine this from the confessions of the faithful that he would hear
during his visitation. In addition, he desired to hear a typical
sermon, and thus saw no need to designate the preacher far in
advance. The sermon would also serve to tell him much about the
quality of the pastoral work being carried out.336
In a 1905 pastoral letter to the clergy of the Stanyslaviv
eparchy, Bishop Hryhorii Khomyshyn informed them that during
visitations he would judge their work with primary attention to
sermons and catechesis. In particular, he would verify whether they
had made the faithful and the youth aware of the Church's basic
principles and given them an understanding of Christ in the
mystery of the Eucharist.337
Deans, too, conducted parish visitations. In the Peremyshl'
eparchy, a dean communicated his results to the episcopal consistory
on a prepared form. One such form printed in 1914 consisted of four
pages including questions on such matters as the pastor himself, the
condition of the church and other parish buildings, pastoral work
(with 23 questions to be asked of the parishioners), the state of parish
records, the treasury, and the teaching of religion in the local school.
A more elaborate and probably later form ran to 12 pages and
included additional questions on church brotherhoods and the
assistant priest, if any.338

In his pastoral letter of 1902 cited above, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi promised to try to attend a meeting of parish clergy in
every deanery. These meetings, known as soborchvky, were to be held
at the end of every canonical visitation. 339 The L'viv Archiepiscopal
Synod of 1897 had set down regulations on the holding of deanery
meetings. As adopted at the Peremyshi' Eparchial Council of 1898,
these rules required three such meetings to be held yearly in each
deanery, though a mission could be substituted for one of these. The
programme was to be decided by the dean, but one written and one
oral presentation must be given at each meeting, for the education of
the priests. The topics could be theological, pastoral, practical,
historical, etc., but political topics and those that might offend must
be avoided. The younger priests would be the first to give talks. The
official report of the Peremyshl' Council stressed the need for
continuing clerical education:
Truly, today more than ever the pastor cannot
stand in one place on the road of knowledge, but
as a representative of his lofty vocation, as a
teacher and leader of the people, absolutely must
progress constantly in the field of learning.. P340
The 1898 regulations were not universally heeded. Bishop
Konstantyn Chekhovych of Peremyshl' sent a circular to his deans
on 9 November 1905 complaining that some of them had not reported
the proceedings of their deanery meetings to the Episcopal
Ordinariat for years.341
Extraordinary deanery meetings were ordered by the
Peremyshl' episcopal ordinariat in 1912. The deans met in
Peremyshl' on 24 January, apparently to discuss priestly solidarity
and the danger of schism. Deans then sent circulars to their clergy
announcing the extraordinary deanery meetings, at which they
would read the bishops' joint pastoral letters of 13 February 1905 on
solidarity in pastoral work, of 11 January 1906 on conduct in public

life, and of 31 March 1910 on schism. Each parish priest would be
asked to report on the condition of his parish.342
Secular Administration
The parish priest's relations with the government and local
administration frequently involved his duty of keeping records of
births and deaths. At the meeting of the Komarno deanery on 7 May
1900, it was noted that the local authorities in Rudky had asked that
in military matters, parish offices should provide extracts from
parish records in the German language. A Fr. Onyshkevych moved
that the priests should continue to provide extracts in the Ruthenian
language, as provided by law, and if the authorities objected, they
should appeal the matter to the highest levels. The motion was
approved unanimously.343
The language of parish extracts and of the records themselves
became a bone of contention between the parish priest and the local
authorities, who in most cases were Polish. In 1912 Fr. A. Holinatyi
wrote in to the clerical journal Nyva relating his experiences with
the district court in Nove Selo. He noted that theretofore, parish
offices had received forms for death certificates in the Ruthenian
language. A few days earlier, however, Fr. Holinatyi had received
Polish-language forms. He returned them to the court, which
responded with a letter explaining that as a state record office, the
parish office must correspond with other authorities in the Polish
language. Fr. Holinatyi complained to Nyva that not all Ruthenian
priests were insisting on using their own language in such
instances. He suggested that if the Ruthenian language were indeed
disallowed in parish records, Ruthenian given names should be
written in Latin transcription -- but not Latin translation -- for
example, "Volodymyr" but not "Vladimirus." 344 As discussed below,
such technical matters would become the subjects of heated
controversy under Polish rule.

Under the Polish Republic, Austrian legislation remained in
effect until new laws were promulgated, but was never entirely
superseded. A decree of the Council of Ministers published on 25
March 1933 listed Austrian laws no longer in effect by virtue of their
inconsistency with the 1925 Polish Concordat; most of these
concerned property.345
The Polish Constitution of 1921 provided for freedom of
conscience and the equality of religious groups. However, the Roman
Catholic faith was first among equals, and the Church enjoyed
internal autonomy. These provisions were re-enacted in the
Constitution of 1935. The Concordat of 1925 gave the state authorities
only a minor influence on church affairs, allowing the Catholic
Church considerable freedom of action and internal administration.
Although Pilsudski's regime and its successors included many
secularising politicians who were far from pro-clerical, on the whole
the government honoured the provisions of both Constitution and
Concordat.346
The Concordat rendered the clergy immune from military
service, legal prosecution in the civil courts, and personal income
tax. It allowed them to conduct the religious education that was
compulsory in state schools. Their salaries were funded from the
property originally confiscated by the partitioning powers, which had
passed to the Polish government after 1918.
The Greek-Catholic bishops did not participate in the
preparatory work or negotiations for the Concordat, and the
Ukrainians in Poland were generally dissatisfied with the
document. 348 In the event, however, the Concordat was not fully put
into practice, as some differences between government and Church
remained unresolved.349
Article 19 re-established the ius praenotificationis, entitling
the government to object to the appointment of a priest to a benefice if

this should be contrary to state security. Under article 20, in such a
case the bishop would have three months to decide whether to
remove the priest. Should the bishop disagree with the government,
the case would be referred to a committee of two priests and two
representatives of the President. 350 In practice, the Greek-Catholic
