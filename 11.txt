adopt the Ukrainian orientation of their faithful. 638 At the same
time, the downfall of Tsarist Russia rendered political Russophilism
virtually irrelevant; after the Bolshevik take-over, it became pointless,
at least for the clergy. 639 It has also been argued that Russophilism
was a moribund philosophy in that it could not absorb the
"revolutionaries" of the younger generation, something which vital
movements are always able to do. 64 ° Furthermore, the end of Tsarist
funding of the Russophile movement removed one of its chief
supports. The fact that in Russian Ukraine, Tsarism had been
supplanted in 1917 by a Ukrainian People's Republic which declared
independence in January 1918 aroused public enthusiasm in Galicia
and vindicated the populist cause. A Western Ukrainian People's
Republic was formed in October 1918, followed by struggle with
Poland over Galicia. All this tended to eclipse Russophile
aspirations. Gradually, Old Ruthenian priests began to go over to the
Ukrainian camp.
While the Old Ruthenians were on the wane in most of Galicia
(albeit retaining the Stauropegial Institute and publishing house
and the People's Home in L'viv), in the Lemko region, the western
section of the Peremyshi' eparchy, the Old Ruthenian clergy and its
Russophile ideology persisted. Perhaps in reaction to Latin-rite and
Polish pressures, as well as to the imposition of compulsory priestly
celibacy in 1925, there was a wave of Orthodox schism in the late
1920s. Some 20 parishes joined the Orthodox Church. 641 This was
reinforced by Lemko separatist tendencies and a reaction against the

It calls on priests who belonged to the Old Ruthenian or Russophile party to
undertake work for "the Ukrainian people." Even a foreigner working among
the Ukrainians must give up his personal patriotism to become "a Ukrainian for
the Ukrainians in order to save their souls."

hectoring of Ukrainian nationalists -- including priests -- from
Eastern Galicia. 642 The Orthodox movement was sufficiently
alarming to the Catholic Church to warrant creation of a special
Apostolic Administration in 1934.643
The Lemko Apostolic Administration appears to have been the
product of the confluence of interests of the Roman Catholic Church
and the Polish government. The government sought to prevent
Ukrainian nationalist influences from entering this area; it was
known that Bishop Kotyslovs'kyi had been sending Ukrainian
nationalist priests to the Lemko region. 644 The Roman Catholic
Church, for its part, saw the need for direct supervision where there
was a danger of mass apostasy. Both the political isolation of the
Lemko region and religious control from Rome would be served by
the creation of the new administrative entity. Of course, the Holy See
and the Polish government also had conflicting aims: the former
wished to preserve Greek Catholicism in the area, while the latter
preferred the advancement of Orthodoxy. Whether the Lemko
Apostolic Administration was a success from either point of view is
difficult to determine, as it had only five years before the German
occupation of these lands irrevocably changed the situation.

Administratora Apostoiskiego Lemkowszczyzny Wasyla Magciucha."
Przemvskie Za piski Historyczne vol. III, 1985, 201. Some of the Greek-Catholic
faithful petitioned church and state authorities to remove priests engaged in the
Ukrainian national movement. Id. 202 (citing Archiwum Akt Nowych,
collection Ministerstwo Wyznai Religijnych i Oswiecenia Publicznego file 378,

Philadelphia, 1970, 42. By October 1939, out of 113 Greek-Catholic priests in the
Lemko Apostolic Administration 76 were considered by the author of a German
document as "Ukrainians" and only 28 "Ruthenians," with the allegiance of 9
uncertain. WAP-P, AAL file 6, pp. 17-39. Out of 21 seminarians who had studied
in Cracow, Tarnów, and Dubno for service in the Administration, seven were
classified in a German document as "Ukrainian" and 14 as "Ruthenian." Id.
pp. 189-191, 193. As mentioned above, the Ukrainophile priests sometimes
annoyed their Lemko parishioners. It was argued, however, that "it was
necessary first to rid the Lemko of Russophilism in order to make him a
Catholic and dispel his sympathies for Orthodoxy." I.H. "Dvadtsiat lit na

(However, the tendency to join the Orthodox Church continues to this
day as a limitation on Latin-rite pressure upon Greek-Catholics in
this region, while the tradition of government support for the
Orthodox Church as a counter-weight to Catholicism of either rite
continues, if anything, more strongly than before.)
Thus, the cultural Russophilism of the Old Ruthenian clergy
found both its apogee and its demise in its ultimate political and
religious consequences. Identification with Imperial Russia died in
the first world war. Apostasy and flight to Russia obviously meant
leaving the Greek-Catholic priesthood. A number of Old Ruthenian
priests died in Austrian internment camps. The passing of
ideological Russophilism coincided with the fall of the priestly
dynasties and the departure of their scions from the priesthood. A
harmless cultural Old Ruthenianism lingered among the elder
Galician clergy. Only in the Lemko region did religious
Russophilism remain strong. While Orthodox conversions occurred
among the Lemko laity, the Russophile clergy in that region
remained staunchly Greek-Catholic. In the meantime, the majority
of the Greek-Catholic priests in Galicia adopted the Ukrainian
national orientation.
2. From Ruthenian Populists to Ukrainian Nationalists
As has been seen above, much of the populist movement, and
particularly its Radical current, was anti-clerical, and relations
between Church and intelligentsia were often hostile. Even the
growing number of populist priests could not accept the tenets of the
laymen with whom they worked in enlightening the village. Yet by
1939, when Ruthenian populists had become Ukrainian nationalists,
the Greek-Catholic clergy were almost entirely in the Ukrainian
national camp. How did this happen?
The answer lies in changes that occurred among both the
clergy and the populist movement, as well as in external political
events. As Russophilism of the Old Ruthenian variety waned and
that of the religious (Orthodox) and political (pro-Russian) type
perished in the world war, the Greek-Catholic clergy sought a new
national and political identity. Radicalism seemed at first to prevent
the kind of cooperation between clerical and lay populist
intelligentsia in "organic work" among the people that had occurred
196
in the 1870s and 1880 g . The gulf between priests and populists had
grown great. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi and Bishops Chekhovych and
Khomyshyn criticised Radicalism in a pastoral letter of 1907 on the
parliamentary elections. 645 The pages of the clerical journal Nyva,
founded in 1904 and supported by Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi, are full
of attacks on Radicalism. 646 After the assassination of the Viceroy
Potocki Metropolitan Sheptytskyi condemned the act in a sermon;
and in a joint pastoral letter addressed to the faithful, the Galician
bishops warned of the dangers of politics without God, declaring that
a crime in the name of patriotism was particularly evil because
people might be tempted to praise jt.647 Populist, if not popular,
opinion roundly criticised the Metropolitan for his condemnation.
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi ignored the hostility of the populists
and supported various national causes. In 1901 he had implicitly
approved of the Ruthenian student strike and had helped the
students pursue their studies abroad. In 1910 he spoke out in the
House of Lords in Vienna in support of a Ukrainian university. In
1913-1914 he was instrumental in the electoral reform that would
have given the Ruthenians political power commensurate with their
numbers. He had blessed the blue and yellow colours of the "Sich
Sharpshooters," a Ukrainian formation in the Austrian army, in
1914. A prisoner of Tsarist Russia, he returned in 1917 to speak out in
the following year against clerical Russophilism and in support of
the Ukrainian orientation. He supported the peace of Brest-Litovsk,
in which the Central Powers recognised the Ukrainian People's
Republic, in Parliament on 28 February 1918. In the succeeding
years, he travelled extensively to gain support for the Ukrainian
state. Upon returning to Poland in 1923 he was interned in Poznaxi by
the government authorities until he agreed to issue a pastoral letter
calling for obedience to the Polish authorities in Galicia.648

648 Different versions of the circumstances and reasons for the arrest have
been advanced. This version is given by Andrzej Ziçba, citing Papierzyi{ska-
Turek, who had access to the minutes of sessions of the Political Committee of
197
Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi was loyal to the Western Ukrainian
dictator Evhen Petrushevych. 649 For the Greek-Catholic clergy,
Sheptyts'kyi legitimised first the Ruthenian populist, and then the
Ukrainian nationalist cause.
The Greek-Catholic priest, however, was no stranger to
politics. 650 Since the mid-nineteenth century various members of the
clergy had held seats in the Galician diet and the parliament in
Vienna, some for long spans of years. Many of these had been Old
Ruthenians.65'
True, with the gradual secularisation of Ruthenian Galician
politics, clerical representation in the elected bodies was diminished.
Nevertheless, with the establishment of the Western Ukrainian
Popular Republic in October 1918, many Greek-Catholic priests were
given the opportunity to participate directly in the experience of
nation-building. Some held important political posts or worked in the
local administration. 652 Others served as chaplains in the Ukrainian
Galician Army in the campaigns against the Poles in 19181919.653
Some past or future seminarians participated as soldiers in these

campaigns. 654 Those who were stationed in eastern Ukraine had an
opportunity to acquaint themselves with the people with which
Ruthenian populists had identified since 1848. The encounter with
an awakening Ukraine, distinct from the Russia adulated by the Old
Ruthenians, fortified the younger clerics' notion of a united
Ukrainian state. 655 In 1919-1921, many priests were arrested or
interned as the Polish authorities took control of Galicia. 656 These
experiences must have played an important part in the formation of
the clergy's political outlook.
Political activism was by no means unique to the Greek-
Catholic clergy. The activist Polish priest was a familiar figure in
nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Poland, particularly in the
Prussian partition. 657 In Galicia, Fr. Józef Panas (1887-1940,
ordained 1911), later known as a political figure, took part as a
military chaplain in the battles for Peremyshi' and L'viv. 658 Abroad,
too, members of the clergy were prominent in politics; in 1922 Fr.
Ignaz Seipel became Chancellor of Austria.
The events of the world war and the Ukrainian war of
liberation prompted the Greek-Catholic priest to define his political
position. As Ruthenian populism developed into Ukrainian
nationalism, it became a more palatable alternative to Russophilism.
At the same time Radicalism, like Russophilism, was to some extent
a casualty of wartime opportunities. Russia was taken over by a left-
wing socialist party. The Western Ukrainian Popular Republic found

itself pitted against Bolsheviks as well as Poles (although a portion of
the Ukrainian Galician Army eventually did join the Red Army after
being driven out of Galicia by Hailer's troops). After the collapse of
Petliura's and Pilsudski's joint eastern offensive, for two and a half
months in the summer of 1920, sixteen districts around Ternopil'
constituted a Galician Soviet Socialist Republic. On 1 August 1920,
the Galician Revolutionary Committee (Halrevkom) declared
separation of Church from state and school. 659 Suddenly, radical left
socialism was a concrete and not altogether pleasant reality.
Although in the 1920s, Ukrainianisation in the Ukrainian SSR made
Bolshevism attractive to some Galician Ukrainians, the liquidation
of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine in 1928 and the
destruction of independent Ukrainian life by Stalin's regime after
1929 tended to discredit left-wing socialism in the eyes of many. As
the Galician Ukrainian political spectrum moved to the right
towards the end of the 1920s, it became easier for the traditionally
conservative Greek-Catholic clergy to find its place in it. In 1925 the
Labour Party regrouped with moderate populists as the Ukrainian
National Democratic Union (UNDO). Around 1928, "Prosvita"
purged its leftist elements. Having long sympathised with
Ruthenian and Ukrainian populism, the clergy could again join
hands with the populists with a clear conscience. As before the war,
a number of priests were politically active. It has even been asserted
that it was the influence of the priests that assured UNDO's
dominance in Ukrainian Galician politics.660
Of course, not all Greek-Catholic priests supported UNDO. The
surviving Old Ruthenians continued to oppose the "Ukrainians" and
maintained total loyalty to Poland. Fr. Mykola fl'kiv of the Ukrainian

worked in "Prosvita" and other social organisations. In 1918 he had organised

Peasant Party announced a normalisation with the Polish
government in 1923.661 Other priests supported a conservative
platform, some following the ideas of Viacheslav Lypyns'kyi
(Wadaw Lipiiski). 662 However, the Galician bishops set an example
in supporting the boycott of the 1922 Polish elections, at a time when
the Polish occupation of Galicia had not been ratified by the League
of Nations, and by protesting against the Council of Ambassadors'
decision of 14 March 1923 awarding Eastern Galicia to Poland.663
The rank and file clergy often defied or circumvented the
requirement, specified in the 1925 Concordat, of reciting a liturgical
prayer for the prosperity of the Republic of Poland and of its
President each Sunday and on the Third of May.664

Acta Aoostolicae Sedis vol. XVII num. 8 (2 June 1925), art. VIII. The form of the
requisite prayer, in Latin, was agreed upon by a conference of bishops in
Warsaw in May of 1925. Appropriate decrees were issued by Bishop Khomyshyn
of Stanyslaviv on 4 March 1926 and by Archbishop-Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi of
L'viv on 15 March 1926. In April 1926, the L'viv district starosta provided the
county authorities with a list of 37 parishes in which Greek-Catholic priests
failed to fully and properly recite the prayer; one priest, according to a
confidential report, said a prayer for Ukraine instead. In June 1926 the L'viv
governor reported to the Ministry of Religious Cults that the majority of the
Ruthenian clergy in Lviv county were not reciting the required prayer. Some
did recite it, but others claimed that they had not received instructions from their
ordinariat. Some priests recited the prayer in a general or ambiguous way, not
clearly naming the Polish state. In August 1927, the department of public security
of the L'viv county government reported to the Ministry of Religious Cults that
most of the Greek-Catholic clergy failed to observe Article VIII of the Concordat.
In the same year, the department of public security of the Cracow county
government reported to the Ministry of Religious Cults that a part of the Greek-
Catholic clergy in the Nowy S4cz and Gorlice districts had failed to celebrate the
Third of May. In the Nowy Sacz district only three priests had held the requisite
service, while ten had desisted; in the Gorlice district, four priests had failed to
hold the service, while two had celebrated only an ordinary liturgy. In two other
districts, however, the clergy had observed the national holiday. In the same
year, nearly 18% of the Greek-Catholic clergy of Stanyslaviv county failed to
celebrate the Third of May. Thirty had failed to do so in Ternopil' county. This
was still a problem in 1930; in 1938, the L'viv county government informed the
Ministry of Cults that the Ruthenian priests mostly did not carry out
satisfactorily the requirements of Article VIII. AAN, MWR i OP file 929, pp. 36,

In the Lemko Apostolic Administration formed in 1934, partly
to cut the area off from Ukrainian agitation by Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi's
nationalist priests, the government kept a close eye on political
developments and apparently pressured the administrator to do
likewise. In 1937, the Administration forbade its clergy to receive the
"chauvinistic Ukrainian" newspapers "Nash Lemko" and
"Ukrains'kyi Beskyd." Forty-seven priests were fined for defying the
order. Some continued nevertheless to obtain the newspapers
through third parties, and to disseminate them among the
Lemkos.665
With the growing nationalist mood of the clergy, a certain
amount of peer pressure could be exerted upon the less patriotic. In
1929 Fr. Vasyl' Prykhidko of the L'viv archeparchy, whose village
had received state aid after a fire, attended a reception in honour of
the Ternopil' governor. Not long after he was expelled from a
gathering on the feast day of a nearby Greek-Catholic parish. His
dean, Fr. Pellikh, circulated a letter throughout the deanery
explaining that the priest hosting the feast-day celebration had
withdrawn his invitation to Fr. Prykhidko because of the latter's
"acts inconsistent with the honour of a Ukrainian priest and former
officer of the Ukrainian army." Dean Pellikh added that all the
clergy "are called and obligated to a decisive struggle against base
slavishness and vileness among the clergy."666 Parishioners, too,
could exert political pressure on their priest.667
The adoption of the Ukrainian nationalist platform presented
problems of another kind. As will be discussed below, it was
necessary to come to terms with the secular culture of greater
Ukraine. Like the Ruthenian populists of the nineteenth century
before them, the Ukrainian nationalists of the inter-war period had

666      In a letter of 29 January 1930 a Polish official, probably Ambassador
Skrzynski at the Polish Embassy to the Holy See, sent this information to an
official of the Secretariat of State of the Holy See, probably Msgr. A. Ottaviani, to
illustrate "the state of mind of a large part of the Ruthenian Catholic clergy and
their attitude to the state and the authorities." Polish Institute (London),

Vypysky, Peremyshliany district). In the first and last cases, the Metropolitan
Curia in L"riv sided with the parishioners. Fr. Palii and Fr. Buchko had
supported Polish political parties; Fr. Tiahnybok had refused to bless water in a
community well decorated with the Ukrainian colours.

developed an heroic view of Ukrainian history which did not fit
neatly into the Greek-Catholic clerical world view. Before World War
One, the Radicals had named their youth organisation "Sich," after
the Zaporozhian Cossack headquarters, and in 1914 the Galician
Ukrainian legions took the name "Sich Sharpshooters." Now the
nationalists developed these historical motifs into an elaborate
mythology. In glorifring Cossack resistance to Polish domination in
the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the nationalists
also exalted Orthodox resistance to Catholicism and the Union. In
idealising the periods of Ukrainian state-building, principally the
creation of a Cossack commonwealth by Bohdan Khmel'nyts'kyi,
they also praised the idea of an autocephalous Ukrainian Church
independent of both Rome and Moscow. Before the first world war, a
seminarian from L'viv travelling to eastern Ukraine could remark
on the sorry state of Orthodoxy, reduced as it was to a state
religion. 668 Catholicism was the only available Ukrainian alternative
to what was commonly called tsareslaviia. In the 1920s, however, a
Ukrainian national Church became a reality on the other side of the
Soviet border. Greek-Catholic clerics were aware of lay sympathies
for the idea of an "autocephalous" Ukrainian Church, free of Polish
intrigues in the higher spheres of Roman Catholic church
politics. 669 Furthermore, the Catholic Church was a supra-national
organisation at odds with nationalist movements in countries like
France or Italy. Thus the anti-clerical strain in populism,
exemplified by the Radicals' hostility towards the "Black
International," continued in Ukrainian nationalism.
There was another problem. Ukrainian nationalism implied a
joining of the entire Ukrainian population, which was
overwhelmingly Orthodox, into a single state. The Greek-Catholic
clergy who joined the nationalist camp would thus have to develop
some sort of coherent attitude to their Orthodox brothers.

fashionable country and was beginning to set the tone for countries and entire

Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi offered an answer by reviving the vision of
his seventeenth-century predecessor losyf Veliamyn Ruts'kyi, who
had attempted a true Union of the Uniate and Orthodox Churches in
a Kievan Patriarchate. 670 The 300th anniversary of Ruts'kyi's death
was elaborately commemorated in 1937. 671 Sheptyts'kyi himself was
an organiser of the Union congresses in Velehrad, and his clergy
participated in similar meetings in Piiisk. The 300th anniversary of
the death of St. Josaphat, now regarded as a Ukrainian martyr for
Church unity, was observed in 1923. However, Metropolitan
Sheptyts'kyi was isolated by the very breadth of his Uniate vision,
which extended culturally beyond Ukraine and ecclesiologically
beyond the simple notion of converting the Orthodox. On the one
hand, it would not be until the Second Vatican Council that such a
liberal attitude towards the Orthodox would become widely accepted
in the Catholic Church. On the other hand, the idea of Union,
particularly a Union extending beyond Ukraine and throughout
Orthodox Russia, was somewhat beyond the immediate concerns of
the average Galician parish priest.
The potential conflict between the clergy and the extreme
nationalists was sharpened in the general radicalisation of politics
in the inter-war period. 672 Veterans of the Ukrainian war of
liberation had founded the underground Ukrainian Military
Organisation (UVO) in the early 1920s. The UVO carried out acts of
sabotage against the Polish regime, and was evidently financed from
abroad. In January 1929, the UVO was broadened into the
Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) at a meeting in
Vienna. Fed by the young, disaffected, and often unemployed village
youth that streamed into the small towns of Galicia during the 1930s,
the OUN developed an ideology inspired by the charismatic Eastern
670 See fn.CjOin the preceding section and the accompanying text.
671 On 14 December 1936, Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi issued a pastoral letter on
this occasion, stressing that the Union had preserved the people's natsional'nist'.
It had saved the people's Catholic faith, their Eastern rite, and their love of their
nation. He further stated that the Union faced the same tasks in the present.

672 According to a Polish account of 1938, the Ukrainian village was similar
to the Polish village except that it was sometimes poorer and was greatly
radicalised in both the communist and the nationalist direction. The author

whereas communism was a product of peasant poverty. "Czarno na Bia,'m" no.

Ukraini)i Dmytro Dontsov. Having provoked the pacification of 1930
(a disproportionate response to crop-burning on Polish estates), its
members retaliated with acts of terror that escalated with each
excessive reaction of the Polish authorities. Polish political activist
Tadeusz Hoówko was assassinated in 1931, Interior Minister
Bronistaw Pieracki in 1934. 673 Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi condemned
the latter act (as well as the harsh policy of the authorities) in a
pastoral letter of 4 August 1934. In the same year he denounced the
murder of the Ukrainian school director Ivan Babii, who had blocked
OUN recruitment among his pupils. The integral nationalist
ideology of the OUN was simply incompatible with Christian
teaching. 674 Similar conflicts were taking place in Germany and
Italy. Although the Lateran accords of 1929 and the German
Concordat of 1933 gave hope of an accord between fascist nationalism
and the Church, Pope Pius Xl's encyclical "Mit brennender Sorge"
of March 1937 criticised German National Socialism, and a series of
verbal conflicts and violent incidents in Germany and Italy
illustrated the irreconcilability of Catholicism and integral
nationalism. 675 In Galicia, the Church was once again at odds with
a significant portion of the national movement.
How the clash of values inherent in this conflict affected the
clergy's moral leadership of Ukrainian society will be discussed in
Chapter Eight. The ideological conflict, however, was of interest to
only some of the parish clergy. 676 One could condemn terrorism and

674 See Chapter 8, Section 2. This problem existed in Polish religious and
political life as well during this period. The relationship between Catholicism
and "totalism" in Poland is explored by Bogumil Grott in "The Conception of

676 At their deanery meetings of June 1939, the clergy of the Turka deanery
discussed the inclusion of patriotic themes in sermons. Nearly all those of the
Bircha deanery discussed a talk by Fr. Savka about "Ideological Directions of
Contemporary Europe." According to the minutes of the latter meeting, the
gathered priests felt that manifestations of Ukrainian nationalism were
moderate reactions to various kinds of provocation. In his talk, Fr. Savka had
discussed socialism, communism, national socialism and fascism in
considerable detail, criticising them all. In particular he criticised the
205
the secular ideologies that justified it, yet sympathise with the
Ukrainian nationalist movement in general terms. This, in fact,
appears to have been the position of the majority of the Ukrainian
Greek-Catholic clergy in the 1930s.
The accord reached between UNDO and the Polish
government in 1935 resulted in a few years of relative peace in
Galicia. However, the creation of an autonomous Carpatho-
Ukrainian entity in October 1938 provided a prototype of the
Ukrainian state. Enthusiastic Galicians swarmed across the
mountains to put their nationalist dreams into practice. Among
them were priests eager to serve as chaplains in the "Carpathian
Sich."677 It was of no small importance to the Galician clergy that
the Carpatho-Ukrainian state was headed by a Greek-Catholic
priest, Rev. Avhustyn Voloshyn. Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi himself
supported Carpatho-Ukraine, while Polish opinion generally
supported the Hungarian troops that crushed it in March 1939.678 In
villages throughout Galicia, Greek-Catholic priests gave rousing
patriotic sermons and celebrated masses for the intention of the
fledgling state, and after the March debacle commemorated its
victims.679
In the 1930s, Metropolitan Sheptyts'kyi avoided direct
participation in politics, intervening only when, as in the case of the
pacification of 1930 680 or the nationalists' terror campaign of the
following years, a moral issue required comment. He favoured the
idea of Catholic organisations -- as opposed to political parties -- that
would influence politics without taking part in political campaigns.

After the pacification of 1930, the Metropolitan sought to repair the
devastation of Ukrainian community life by proposing in October
1930 an apolitical organisation to be known as the Ukrainian
Catholic Alliance. 681 Created in 1931, the Alliance published the
newspaper "Meta." Its activity was generally confined to the L'viv
archeparchy. In 1936 the metropolitan issued a pastoral letter which
in its condemnation of communism anticipated Pope Pius XIs
encyclical "Divini Redemptoris" of the following year. 682 He did
maintain friendly relations with nationalist leaders, and was
attacked in the Sejm by B. Wojciechowski on 15 February 1938 for his
allegedly anti-Polish activities. 683 Bishop Kotsylovs'kyi of Peremyshl',
considered in Polish quarters to be a Ukrainian nationalist, quietly
fostered a nationally conscious Ukrainian clergy.
In the Stanyslaviv eparchy, a somewhat different situation
arose. In 1925, a Ukrainian Christian Organisation was formed in
L'viv, but mainly served the Stanyslaviv eparchy under Bishop
Khomyshyn's direction. 684 In 1926, Bishop Khomyshyn formed the
Ukrainian Catholic Popular Party. Inspired to a great extent by the
talented journalist Osyp Nazaruk, who also edited "Nova Zoria," the
organisation advocated legality and cooperation with the Polish
authorities. Together with the "Skala" reading-rooms (see Chapter
Five), the Party represented Bishop Khomyshyn's attempt to build a
truly Catholic Ukrainian political, social and cultural edifice that
would provide an alternative to atheistic Communism and anti-
Christian nationalism. Already at odds with the secular
intelligentsia over their alleged Radical tendencies, the Bishop took
on the Ukrainian nationalists, elaborating his ideas in pastoral
letters 685 and in a book published in 1933.686 In February 1939 he

publicly criticised the Ukrainian national independence movement
as a threat to the Church, pointing out that the Ukrainian Popular
Republic of 1917-1921 had been governed by anti-clerical
intellectuals.687
Some parish priests outside the Stanyslaviv eparchy, too,
shared Bishop Khomyshyn's perspective. Few if any joined the OUN,
though Fr. Isydor Nahaievs'kyi was among the suspected Ukrainian
nationalists confined at the Bereza Kartuska concentration camp set
up in 1934. Apparently, most of the Greek-Catholic clergy of the
1930s sympathised with UNDO, which continued to pursue a
moderate nationalist line combining civic loyalty to the Polish state
with the ultimate goal of Ukrainian independence. In many
Galician villages, the priest faced an increasingly excited nationalist
mood among the parishioners, OUN recruitment among the youth
and some Communist agitation on the fringes of society. Typically,
his own attitude could be described as a fervent but politically
undefined Ukrainian nationalism in full harmony with his religious
convictions and his priestly role.
In 1916 Fr. Iuliian Dzerovych, writing in Nyva about the
clergy's wartime experiences, made the following prediction:
We therefore believe that the ancient, glorious
tradition of the past, which inseparably joined
our clergy with our people, will be resurrected.
The strength and significance of the clergy will
undoubtedly increase after the war, for now it
has become apparent what individuals full of
dedication, full of heroism it was provided with.
We believe that our Catholic faith, which
showed so much inconsummable faith in those
days, which gave protection to persecuted
Ukrainianism, will become our national
treasure, disputed by none, that it will become a
national religion acknowledged by all.688

CHAPTER SEVEN: RELIGIOUS
AND CULTURAL IDENTITY
What's most sacred in man's sight --
A Botocudo bold is he! --
Is, besides his ABC,
The sacred Greco-Uniate rite.
For it is a rite to see!
For it is so
Rich and splendid
No one truly
Understands it!
Should one kneel or should one stand,
Should one ring once, twice or thrice,
Should one say "mvr Dravoslavnvi"
Or should one say "pravovirnvi,"
How should altars be aligned,
How should icons be designed,
Is a priest to shave his face,
Or to leave his beard in place?
All is smothered in entangling
Quarrels ritual and dogmatic,
All this draws us into wrangling
Camps of papists and schismatics.
Ivan Franko (1880) 689
At the moment when the present Metropolitan
of Halych became the Bishop of Stanyslaviv, our
Greek-Catholic Church in Galicia presented a
curious ideological physiognomy. Distanced from
the East, it did all it could to renounce Eastern
church traditions, gladly accepting from the
Latin Church -- even in matters of rite and
discipline -- all that could bring it closer to the
Latin West, of course in the mistaken conviction
that only that which was Latin could be truly
Catholic. It had totally lost its understanding of
its great mission in the Universal Church, it was
simply unaware of that special role which history
had assigned to it -- to be a vital propagator of the
idea of Union in the ecclesiastical East. Boarded
up in its Galician ghetto and guaranteed the
protection of the Austrian monarchy, it was far
from that active life, both internal and external,
with which it once had been expected to fulfill the
hopes of Pope Urban VIII.
