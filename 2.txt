out of a population of 4,814,171 in 1900, Greek-Catholics constituted
3,022,929 while Latin-rite Catholics amounted to 1,131,330. 25 Although
religious denomination is not a perfect indicator of nationality --
there were Greek-Catholic Poles as well as Latin-rite Catholic
Ruthenians (though these were frequently regarded by their co-
nationals as victims of assimilation) -- these latter figures give a
rough idea of the relative proportions of Ruthenians and Poles in
Eastern Galicia. In Western Galicia, by contrast, the Ruthenians
tended to be linguistically polonised, except in the mountainous
Lemko region in the south.
After World War I and the fall of Austria-Hungary, the
traditional socio-economic and cultural problems of Galicia were
compounded by the difficulties faced by the new Polish state. For the
Ruthenians -- who after their war of independence of 19 18-1920
generally regarded themselves as part of the greater Ukrainian

nation -- there were added the difficulties of rebuilding their life in
the confines of an often hostile national state.
Many of Poland's economic problems were characteristic of
those of inter-war Eastern Europe. In agriculture, the persistence of
strip farming and the large number of dwarf holdings (5 hectares or
less), complicated by the continuing subdivision of landholdings
among the sons of a family, retarded progress. Competition from
American grain and, from about 1930, the effects of the Depression
(especially the dramatic fall in the price of wheat on home markets),
aggravated the situation. The disparity between the prices of
industrial goods (such as ploughs), which remained fairly high, and
the falling prices of agricultural goods -- the notorious "price
scissors" -- contributed to the impoverishment of the peasantry. Only
in the last few years before the outbreak of World War II did a limited
agricultural recovery take place.26
Poland also had to repair the devastation of the World War,
much of which had been fought on what was now her territory.
Agriculture had been particularly hard hit. There was the added
difficulty of integrating the formerly Prussian, Russian and
Austrian lands with their varying systems of communication,
transportation, and education, as well as their disparate economic
orientations. Inflation was very high in the first five years of
independence. Unemployment was rife. The country was
underindustrialised, and little foreign investment in Polish industry
ever materialised. Despite large-scale projects like Gdynia and the
Central Industrial Region, industrialisation developed too slowly.
Growing economic nationalism abroad obstructed Poland's foreign
trade as world agricultural surpluses depressed prices and hindered
her exports. Trade barriers prohibited Poland from obtaining the
foreign exchange she needed to buy imports required for
industrialisation. Meanwhile, the country's standard of living slowly
declined. Land reform, with its attendant parcellation of large
estates, never went far enough, and immigration -- restricted by the

United States in the 1920s and by other states during the Depression -
- never sufficed to relieve the overpopulation of the countryside.27
The state of Poland's agriculture was of particular relevance to
the Ukrainians of Galicia, including the Greek-Catholic clergy. The
overwhelming majority of the population -- for example, 81.3% in
Ternopil county -- were engaged in farming. 28 Overpopulation of the
countryside remained acute, and emigration (about 578,000 in
Eastern Galicia in 1919-1925, about 964,000 in 1926-1930) did not
relieve it here any more than elsewhere in Poland; furthermore,
about half the emigrants returned.29
Also among the problems facing Polish agriculture as a whole
were a lack of capital, primitive techniques, and the land ownership
system. The agricultural yield of wheat in Poland was less than that
of fifteen other European countries in the 1930s. In 1921, 33.9% of the
landholdings were of two hectares or less; another 30.7% were of
between two and five hectares. Together, these constituted 15.3% of
the area under cultivation. Yet five hectares was considered to be the
minimum amount of land needed to support a family. Four million
peasants had no land at all. At the same time, a mere 0.6% of the
holdings, consisting of estates of over a hundred hectares, accounted
for 43% of the land being cultivated. This concentration of ownership
was probably greater than that of any other European country except
Hungary. 30
In the inter-war period commassation of landholdings, an
antidote to wasteful strip farming, was carried out. By 1938, over 40%
of the land involved in the program had been commas sed. 31
The most ambitious reform, however, was the Land Reform
aimounced by a resolution of Parliament in July 1919, and voted into
law in July 1920 under the pressure of the Bolshevik advance, but not
put into effect until the law of 1925 established agrarian offices to
carry it out. Under the reform in its final version, the state would pay
for half the value of an owner's land subject to the reform in cash,

and half in government bonds. The beneficiary would pay five percent
down with forty-one years to pay off the rest, financing to be provided
by the State Land Bank. In addition to private holdings, land of the
State, the Catholic Church (under the 1925 Concordat) and other
public institutions was subject to state purchase. (The parcellation of
Church lands will be discussed in Chapter Three.) General
landholders could retain holdings of no more than 180 hectares;
however, the limit in suburban and industrial areas was 60 hectares,
and in the East, where the landowners were usually Polish and the
beneficiaries of parcellation would have been Belorussians or
Ukrainians, the limit was 300 hectares. 32
The land reform, once it was under way, accommodated only
about a third of the increase of the rural population, with some
130,000 hectares distributed each year. Moreover, the financial
obligations incurred by the recipients of land proved heavy. Worse
still, the average size of small holdings decreased steadily. The
reform was slowed up after Pilsudski's 1926 coup and his
rapprochement with the conservatives, but sped up again under the
Kocia1kowski government in 1935. The greatest progress was in the
eastern and central provinces. However, many landowners took
advantage of the provision of the reform act allowing the owner to
dispose of the land subject to the reform within twelve months of
publication of the notice of expropriation. There was a tendency to
dispose of the inferior part of a holding, and often the purchaser was
a well-to-do peasant rather than a landless peasant or small-holder.
Nevertheless, by 1938 the reform was two-thirds complete, and
the decrease in the number of large estates as well as dwarf holdings
testified to a levelling process -- though this did not relieve the
growing pressure of population on the land. 34 In 1939, there were still
two million farms --over half the peasant holdings -- that were not
large enough to maintain the cultivators at subsistence. On the other
hand, estates of over 50 hectares, owned by fewer than 30,000
individuals, constituted about 24% of the total area under cultivation
in Poland.

From the point of view of the Ukrainian peasants of Galicia,
the reform was not necessarily a good thing. Aside from the
discriminatory differential in the maximum permissible size of
holdings favouring the Polish landowners, there was the fact that the
parcelled lands frequently went to Polish colonists from other
provinces rather than to local Ukrainians. At the same time, the
Ukrainian farm workers employed on large estates that were
parcelled lost their jobs. 36
However, Stanislaw Skrzypek points out that the state
guaranteed the Ukrainians at least an equal share of the parcelled
lands in spite of the fact that the estates belonged mainly to Poles
(thus evidently assuming that the Ukrainians would not normally be
entitled to land parcelled out from Polish-held estates). He cites a
figure of 872,000 acres parcelled in Eastern Galicia between 1919 and
1938, of which 495,000 went th Ukrainians.
Agriculture was no less immune to the ravages of the
Depression than the rest of the Polish economy. The harbinger of
depression was the fall of world timber prices with the reappearance
of Russia on the world market in 1928. Wheat prices fell in the
autunm of 1929 with the over-production of wheat in America and
continued to fall in the following years, bringing down the prices of
other raw agricultural products, on which the balance of trade of
most East European countries depended. However, this disaster for
the small farmer did less harm to the seasonal labourer (so common
among the Ukrainians of Eastern Galicia) working on large estates,
as he was usually paid in kind, with a percentage of the crop he had
harvested. 38
One effect in Eastern Europe of the international
depression was an increasing economic self-reliance, which
contributed to political nationalism and undermined internationalist
tendencies among the working class. Discontent arose among the
older civil servants, victims of cost cuts, and the army officers, as well
as among the recent university graduates who could not find work.
In the countryside, the owner-farmers (rather than the labourers)
most resented the high industrial prices and interest rates. In

Poland as elsewhere in Eastern Europe, in view of the heavy Jewish
representation in banking and industry, such feelings were easily
translated into anti-Semitism. The scarcity of jobs exacerbated inter-
ethnic tensions in general. Throughout Eastern Europe, the position
of national minorities began to deteriorate.39
Poland seemed to be faced with intractable problems.
Broad economic discontent surfaced in the general strike of
November 1923, the industrial strikes of 1936, and the agricultural
strike of August 1937. Even the most energetic reforms could not
solve the country's difficulties. Although the judgment of Samuel
Sharp, describing the government's programmes as
"bureaucratically inspired economic activity of a kind which evoked
sneering comments from a diffident population," may be harsh, one
must agree with his evaluation that "after twenty years the gap
between needs and achievements was not sufficiently narrowed in
terms of many things that mattered." 40
There were, of course, private efforts to deal creatively with
these economic problems, not least among the Ukrainians of Galicia
(or, as it was then officially known, Eastern Little Poland). To an
extent this was a matter of reviving and developing the institutions
that they had organised under Austrian rule. Although Raymond
Leslie Buefl, writing in the 1930s, concluded that the cooperative
could not meet Poland's economic needs, particularly in Eastern
Poland where the peasants were illiterate, 41 the Ukrainian
cooperative movement forged ahead under Polish rule. This was in
great part the work of veterans of the Ukrainian Galician Army who
had studied in Czechoslovakia and returned to Galicia in the mid-
1920s to re-open and expand the cooperatives closed or destroyed
between 1914 and 1923.
In 1923 there were 830 Ukrainian consumer cooperatives in
Galicia. Retail cooperatives were organised under "Tsentrosoiuz,"
while the dairy cooperative "Maslosoiuz" came to produce a fifth of
Poland's butter exports. Credit and savings cooperatives arose as
well. By 1935 these various institutions, organised in the Audit Union
of Ukrainian Cooperatives, claimed over 542,000 members; two years
later they had 661,000. By 1935 they had created 12,500 jobs. Also of aid

to the farmers were the Agrarian Mortgage Bank and the
organisation "Silskyi Hospodar," continued from Austrian times,
which in 1936 had 63 branches and 107,200 members -- an enormous
increase in membership over the 27,000 claimed in 1912. The
"Dnister" insurance association was restored as well. 42 According to
some Ukrainian sources, the Ukrainian cooperatives received no aid
from the Polish government, though a Polish source disagrees. In
any case, the cooperatives did raise the peasants' economic status --
and with it their national consciousness.
The Ukrainians of Eastern Galicia suffered social-cultural as
well as economic difficulties in inter-war Poland. Employment was
often contingent on converting from the Greek to the Latin Catholic
rite. 45 Of the 600 workmen at the Polonia petroleum refinery, only ten
were Ukrainians, and these were reportedly pressured to avoid
joining any Ukrainian party or organisation. 46 In their search for
jobs, the young intelligentsia were hampered both by general
conditions of unemployment in Poland and by national
discrimination, particularly in government and education.
Ukrainian judges were removed or transferred to ethnically Polish
areas. The local administration was overwhelmingly Polish. Polish
colonists (often ex-servicemen), settled in Eastern Galicia after 1919,
competed for land and jobs. In 1939 the Ukrainian politician Vasyl'
Paneiko asserted that the Poles had monopolised public employment,
hindered instruction in the Ukrainian language, established a
numerus clausus in higher education, and taken measures against
the Ukrainian cooperatives. Indeed, of the 120 to 140 students
admitted to the medical school at the University of L'viv there were
only two Ukrainians in 1931, nine in 1932, six in 1933, and ten in each
of the two following years. Whereas twelve subjects had been taught

Hospodar" he cites only 85 branches with 12,500 members in 1910, 81 with 28,000
members in 1930, and the same figures as Yaremko for 1936; the number of
village groups also increased, from 317 in 1910 to 1122 in 1930 and 1683 in 1936,

at that university before World War I, under Polish rule all courses
were taught in Polish. ''
Education was a serious problem throughout Poland,
especially in the rural areas; the ethnic problem, pronounced in the
Galician countryside, complicated it further. As against a national
average of 32.7% illiteracy among persons over ten years of age, the
rate of illiteracy was 38.7% in Ternopil' county and 40.4% in
Stanyslaviv county in 1921. By the late 1930s, however, these figures
had fallen to 29.8% and 36.6%, respectively.48 The Austrian system of
separate Polish and Ukrainian schools was abandoned, and under
the 1924 school law (the "1. Grabski") the mixed Polish-Ukrainian
"utraquistic" school was introduced, with courses in both Polish and
Ukrainian (though even the latter were frequently taught by Poles).
Thus, the number of schools with Ukrainian as the principal
language of instruction dropped from 2,417 in 1924 to 457 in the late
1930s; the number of bi-lingual schools, on the other hand, reached
2,230. 49 There were 452 Ukrainian-language elementary schools in
1938, and 2,485 utraquistic schools. However, in that year there were
21 secondary schools with Ukrainian as the language of instruction,
and only two bilingual ones; there were 19 Ukrainian lycees and two
bilingual lycees. 50 The "Ridna Shkola" society was founded to
provide private schooling in the Ukrainian language. In 1938 it had
107, 332 members and maintained 33 elementary schools. 51
In higher education, the five-year course of the Greek-Catholic
Theological Academy established in L'viv in 1928 provided the
equivalent of university education, while Ukrainian professors
taught at L'viv, Cracow and Warsaw Universities. In 1930 the Polish
government set up a Ukrainian Scientific Institute in Warsaw. The
issue of a Ukrainian university, however, was never settled; the
government proposed that such an institution should be situated in
Cracow while the Ukrainians insisted on L'viv. Between 1921 and
1926 an underground Ukrainian university functioned in L'viv with
1,500 students. 52 Adult education continued to be provided by

"Prosvita," now under the influence of the Ukrainian National
Democratic Union (UNDO). It grew from a membership of 6,900 in
1925 to 31,100 ten years later, and operated 3,017 reading rooms in
1935 (as compared with 2,376 in 1910), with 295 "central" reading
rooms in that year (114 in 1910).
The publication of Ukrainian-language newspapers and other
periodicals in Galicia rose from around 72 before 1910 to 129 in 1926,
including 28 political, some 16 religious, and 19 cultural, literary and
scholarly publications. By 1937 the Ukrainian religious press alone
counted 20 titles on Ukrainian lands in Poland, including 12 Greek-
Catholic titles in Eastern Galicia.
Social organisations were likewise revived after World War I.
The "Sokil" athletic organisation, now affiliated with UNDO, claimed
8,000 members with 508 branches in 1930. "Sich" was reorganised as
"Luh," still under Socialist-Radical influence, though in 1926 some
branches allied themselves with the nationalist camp. In 1929 "Luh"
had over 700 branches. The youth organisation "Plast" was
prohibited in 1930, however. The Union of Ukrainian Women grew
from 25,000 members in 1935 to 45,000 in 1937.
Albeit in different proportions, both Poles and Ukrainians in
Galicia had their intellectuals, merchants, peasants and industrial
workers. Each social group experienced contact, and conflict, with
the corresponding group of the other nation. The Ukrainian
bourgeoisie numbered about 10,000 in Poland. The "petite
bourgeoisie" constituted only about 2.5% of Ukrainian society but was
growing, due to the entry of Ukrainians into small trade. The
intelligentsia consisted mostly of priests, teachers and managers of
cooperatives rather than lawyers, physicians or journalists. 58 The
inter-war period was marked by Ukrainian migration from country
to city and by the rise of a village intelligentsia.

and Western European cultural currents, can only be hinted at here.
In 1900, Western Ukrainian literature was leaving behind the folk
ways of the village and aspiring to Western urban cultural models.
By 1939, a strong sense of membership in the European cultural
community had emerged. Folk tradition continued to inspire the
plastic arts, music and literature, but no longer monopolised their
style or content.
The role of the Greek-Catholic Church in Eastern Galician
society will be discussed in detail in subsequent chapters. Here it
should suffice to quote two observations, the first by Raymond Leslie
Buell (1939), the second by Stanisaw Skrzypek (1948):
Although the Uniat Church was originally
created to win over the Ukrainians to Poland, it
now serves as a national church, playing a role
not unlike that played by the Catholic Church
with respect to Polish nationalism during the
nineteenth century. 60
the Greek Catholic had the characteristics
of a national Ukrainian church. It had
enormous influence a m o n g t h e
Ukrainian people and was a pillar of
moderation and common sense in various
periods of tension in Polish-Ukrainian
relations. 61
During the period under study, the demographic picture did
not change radically, apart from the effects of overpopulation and
emigration mentioned above. In 1921, Ukrainians made up about 14%
of the population of Poland; estimates of their number have ranged
from three million (and a census figure of 3,898,431) to ten million.
For 1931, some Polish sources cited a figure of 4.8 million, though the
census figure was only 3,227,000 or 10.1% of the population, while
some Ukrainians claimed to number six or seven million. 62 In
Eastern Galicia, "Ukrainians and Rusyns" constituted 52.3% of the
population in 1931 (Greek-Catholics and Orthodox together coming to

27
58.3%), while Poles made up 41.7% (with 30.6% Roman Catholics).63
In the late 1930s, the number of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia was
about 3,500,000, with the vast majority in the countryside. (The towns
were mostly Polish and Jewish.) 64 In 1931 the number of Greek-
Catholics was 3,336,200 according to the census. 65 By 1939, a
Ukrainian ethnographer found that Ukrainians made up 64.2% of
the Eastern Galician population, Poles 16%, and latvnnvky (Latin-rite
Catholics of Ukrainian ethnic origin) 8.8%. 66 While some of the
estimates indicate a decline in the number of Ukrainians in the
region, it is difficult to determine whether this may not have been the
result of census methods; it is also possible that there was a good deal
of ethnic assimilation, aided by transfers of Catholics to the Latin
from the Greek rite.
The economic, social and cultural difficulties faced by
Ruthenians under Austria continued into the Polish period,
aggravated by the specific difficulties of reborn Poland. Yet the
private initiatives of this group as it grew in its Ukrainian
consciousness overcame many of these problems. These efforts were
closely connected with, and inspired by, political currents.
2. Political Lit
While the socio-economic and cultural life of the Ruthenians
(Ukrainians) in Eastern Galicia formed a rough continuum over the
final years of Austrian rule and the period of the Second Polish
Republic, political life, not surprisingly, changed its course
somewhat after 1918. This was due to a combination of new political
circumstances on the one hand, and trends that had been developing
in the province over the past several decades on the other.
In the 1930s Raymond Leslie Buell observed that "what the
Polish problem was in the nineteenth century, the Ukrainian
problem may become in the twentieth." 67 In the period from 1900 to
1939, these two rising nationalisms, both claiming the same territory,
clashed, first in the multinational political arena of the Austrian

Empire, then more openly when the one found its embodiment in a
national state frustrating the ambitions of the other.
From the 1870s the Galician Poles, first represented by the
landowning szlachta and later by the middle class, sought greater
provincial autonomy by participating actively in government. They
also made great strides in "organic work," improving the economic,
educational and cultural level of the province. The provincial statute
of 1867 and the polonisation of education and local government made
Galicia a focus of Polish life in the Partition period. Poles attained
high positions in the provincial as well as the central imperial
administrations. 68
Austrian policy turned from favouring the Ruthenian revival
to indulging Polish demands in Galicia. However, the Vienna
government continued to see the Ruthenians of Ukrainian
orientation as a counterweight to Polish influence. Foreign policy
considerations also prompted Vienna to favour the Ukrainophiles,
who opposed Russia, and to counteract the Russophile "Old
Ruthenians."
The conservative Poles, on the other hand, supported the Old
Ruthenians, if only because they were a split in the Ruthenian camp.
Besides, the Old Ruthenians, who were particularly strong among
the Greek-Catholic clergy, represented a socially conservative force,
while the Ukrainophile populists tended to be socially radical if not
outright socialists.69
The Old Ruthenians were organised in the Rada Rus'ka
(Ruthenian Council) formed in 1870, the Populists in the Narodna
Rada (People's or National Council) of 1885. Radicalism had suffered
a temporary eclipse as some conservative clerics made their
influence felt in the Populist movement, but returned in the 1880s
and later as a Populist faction. 70
The Ruthenians (who began to identify themselves as
Ukrainians around the turn of the century) entered Austrian politics
in an organised manner in the late 1870s, shortly after the Poles.

However, they had little success in the elections. In the 1890s a
number of new political parties were formed: the Ukrainian Radical
Party (1890), the Ukrainian Social-Christian Party (1896), the
Ukrainian Social-Democratic Party (a split-off from the
Radicals)(1896), and the Ukrainian National Democratic Party
(including a number of former Radicals and Populists)(1899).
The growth of the Ukrainophile tendency in Ruthenian
populism was aided by the influx of Ukrainian intelligentsia from
the Russian Empire, especially after the 1876 Ems ukase severely
restricting publishing in the Ukrainian language. L'viv became the
centre of Ukrainian political as well as cultural activity. The socialist
historian Mykhailo Hrushevs'kyi, who held the chair of Ukrainian
history at the University of L'viv, and the radical socialist
theoretician Mykhailo Drahomanov, who maintained contacts with
the Galician intelligentsia from Swiss exile, exerted great influence
on the Populists. Although there was sometimes friction between the
socially radical Eastern Ukrainians and the conservative Galicians --
the Kaisertreu "Tyroleans of the East" -- they agreed on a broad
populist platform, opposed Polish hegemony, and led the Ruthenian-
Ukrainian revival. As the Russophiles, who had begun the
Ruthenian revival decades earlier, lost influence, a new breed of
populist intellectuals -- teachers, scholars and lawyers, often from
priestly families -- took the lead. They agitated for the division of
Galicia into East and West and for national autonomy for Ukrainians
within the Empire. Some, notably the Radicals, pressed for full
Ukrainian independence in union with a free Eastern Ukraine,
though for many this was only an ultimate goal to be subordinated
for the moment to more moderate demands. The title of Iuliian
Bachyns'kyi's Ukrain p Irredenta (1897) speaks for itself. At the same
time, some moderate Populists sought a compromise with the Poles:
in the 1890s the "New Era" movement under Iuliian Romanchuk
negotiated with some success with the Galician Viceroy Count
Badeni. There were also appeals to the highest government levels,
though Emperor Franz Josef s notorious dismissal of a Ruthenian
delegation in 1895 dampened such hopes. In any case, mounting
Polish success in the capital obstructed Ukrainian efforts. Such
disappointments, together with a deteriorating economic situation in
the 1890s, favoured the Radicals. When in 1899 the moderate Radical
30
wing joined with the Populists to form the National Democratic
Party, the new formation's platform of Ukrainian unification and
land reform made it the most broadly based and influential
Ukrainian movement of the next four decades. With the decline of the
Old Ruthenians, it also became the favoured political movement of
the Greek-Catholic clergy. 71 (This development will be discussed in
Chapter Six.)
The growth of Ukrainian nationalism inevitably conflicted
with the already entrenched interests of the Galician Poles. The
notion of co-existence among Poles, Ruthenians and Galicia's other
nationalities -- if it ever commanded much support -- quickly lost
ground. 72 Professor Estreicher asserts that "all Polish parties and
all the Polish statesmen who ruled Galicia stood by the principle that
the Ruthenes must be allowed to develop their nationality and use
their language in office and in schools," and blames the breakdown
in cooperation on the Ruthenians' low cultural level, their lack of
educated men, and their primitive political approach. Certainly the
Populists' demand for the partition of Galicia meant the
transformation of the eastern half into a Ukrainian land. But this
was hardly more extreme than the notion of Eastern Galicia as part
of a Polish land, long the position of the "Podolian" landowners who
would not countenance co-existence with the Ruthenians on
anything like equal terms. Meanwhile, the rise of the Polish National
Democrats from 1900 boded ill for Ruthenian-Ukrainian autonomy.
One focus of the Polish-Ukrainian struggle was the question of
electoral reform. The Poles generally favoured provincial autonomy
on the basis of the curial system of indirect representation, which
worked to their advantage inasmuch as they controlled most of the
curiae. The Ukrainians, a numerical majority in the eastern part of
the province, favoured the most direct representation. In this they
enjoyed the support of the Polish left. There were also allegations of
electoral corruption, while the "bloody" elections of 1897 left a painful
memory. The introduction of universal suffrage through direct
voting for parliamentary elections in 1907 raised the question of
electoral reform for the Galician Diet. Viceroy Potocki's support of
the Russophile Old Ruthenians prompted his assassination by

Myroslav Sichyns'kyi, a Ukrainophile, in April 1908. His successor,
MichaI Bobrzyiski, sought electoral reform and a Polish-Ruthenian
settlement. His support of the Ukrainian Populists and his opposition
to the Russophiles ran afoul of local Polish opinion, and it was finally
the opposition of the Roman Catholic hierarchy to his reform that led
to his resignation in 1913. It was only under his successor, Witold
Korytowski, that a complex plan for electoral reform was adopted, in
January 1914. It was also agreed that a Ukrainian university would
be founded.
About this time, Polish opinion began to tend away from
Austria and towards Russia, reinforced in this by reports of German
support for the Ukrainians. Aside from the Russophiles, who
expected a Russian victory in a future war and hoped that a
victorious Russia would grant them autonomy, the Ukrainians
remained firmly loyal to the Habsburgs. Indeed, even some of the
Russophiles became disillusioned when the Russian occupation
authorities who ruled Galicia in the first year of the World War
proved insensitive to their aspirations (see Chapter Six). Meanwhile,
Ukrainian politicians continued to press for the creation of a
separate Eastern Galician crownland, to be joined by Bukovyna and
Transcarpathia. '
With the outbreak of war in 1914 the Ukrainian political
parties formed the Supreme Ukrainian Council under the National
Democrat Konstantyn Levyts'kyi and declared their support for
Austria-Hungary. In 1915 this group was reorganised as the General
Ukrainian Council.
Throughout the war the Poles and Ukrainians vied with each
