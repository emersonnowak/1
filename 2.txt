INTRODUCTION: SOCIETY, POLITICS AND
THE CHURCH IN EASTERN GALICIA,1900-1939
The changes in the educational and socio-economic status of
the Greek-Catholic clergy in Eastern Galicia from 1900 to 1939, the
development of its political and cultural attitudes and its sense of
social role must be seen against the background of socio-economic,
cultural and political developments in Galicia during this period. In
this chapter, therefore, an attempt will be made to outline these
developments under Austrian and Polish rule, insofar as they are
relevant to the topic of this dissertation.
The modern history of Western Ukraine, including that of
Eastern Galicia, is generally treated in segments, with the Habsburg
and Polish periods dealt with separately. Although the political
changes occurring after the First World War In part justify such an
approach, the broad socio-economic and cultural situation remained
to a great extent unchanged, representing a rough continuum over
the forty-year period with which this study is concerned. Indeed, even
the political changes were not as radical as might at first appear:
Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia had to deal with a Polish local
administration before 1918 as well as after. And although they could
no longer appeal for protection to an Emperor eager to control the
Polish autonomous movement, the forms of democratic government
did provide similar opportunities for pressing their case by appeals to
the national interest. Consequently, the Austrian and Polish periods
will not be dealt with separately in this chapter; instead, an outline of
the Ukrainians' socio-economic and cultural development and of
their political life spanning the period between 1900 and 1939 will be
provided.
Although this is not the place for an analysis of over-all socio-
economic and cultural conditions in the Habsburg Empire or inter-
war Poland, it is important to keep in mind that whereas some of the
problems of Eastern Galicia were unique to that region, others were
typical of the entire state of which it was a part. Furthermore, it will
not be possible in this study to determine which conditions were the
results of state policy and which simply developed out of the existing
situation. Consequently, in describing socio-economic and cultural
conditions we shall not venture in every case to judge whether they
represented government policies, or to determine whether such
14
policies were directed exclusively toward Eastern Galicia. Nor shall
we always seek to determine whether these policies were aimed at
the Ukrainians or the Poles alone. Rather, the object of this chapter is
to describe the context in which the Greek-Catholic clergy lived,
learned and worked, and in which they formed their attitudes about
contemporary issues and about their role in society.
The survey of political developments will focus on the
Ruthenian (Ukrainian) national movement, in which the Greek-
Catholic clergy played a vital part. It is important to remember, of
course, that in twentieth-century Eastern Galicia there were in fact
two conflicting national movements. While in the Austrian period
the Ruthenian awakening followed in the footsteps of the Polish
independence movement, after 1918 Eastern Galicia saw the
inevitable conflict between a successful national movement that was
seeking to consolidate its newly-won statehood, and a frustrated one
in direct conflict with the former and claiming the same territory.
1. Economic, Social    ncJ. Cultural   Lif.
What were the economic, social and cultural conditions in
which the Ruthenian-Ukrainian movement developed, and which
formed the context of its political expressions, in the last two decades
of Habsburg Austria and the following two decades of Polish rule?
At the turn of the century Eastern Galicia was one of the
poorest places in Europe. 13 At the same time it was the "Piedmont of
Ukraine," where the cultural energies of the nation on either side of
the Russian border were concentrated. The tension contained in this
paradox may explain the remarkable political energy of the Galician
Ukrainians during the ensuing decades.
For the peasants, who formed the overwhelming majority of
the population then known as Ruthenian, the principal socio-
economic problem was over-population. It was not simply a matter of
too many people, however, but rather of a high birth rate combined
with scarce available land and low agricultural productivity. Neither
the high death rate nor the heavy emigration (in 1911, over 14,200
peasants left for Canada, and as many for the United States) sufficed
to alleviate this problem and the attendant poverty. The constant
13     Galician poverty even figured as the title of Ignacy Daszyitski's 0 Ndzv
Galicvjskiej. Krakow, 1897.
15
division of land left a plethora of small holdings, many of which were
insufficient to support the families living on them. Furthermore,
there was a glaring contrast between large estates and "dwarf
holdings, while many peasants were altogether landless. Some 25
large landowners held about a fifth of the land. At the other end of the
scale, over 100,000 peasants, for example, found it necessary to
migrate to Germany as seasonal labourers in 1912-1913. 14
At the same time, both government and private efforts were
made to alleviate the desperate conditions in Eastern Galicia. In the
wake of the massive and largely successful peasant strike of 1902,
over 180 estates were parcelled between 1902 and 1910. However, the
beneficiaries of the parcellation were generally Polish colonists
rather than the indigenous Ruthenians; similarly, central and local
state subsidies for drainage, flood control and such purposes tended
to go to Western rather than Eastern Galicia, and the predominantly
Polish local officials interfered with the Ruthenian peasants' private
efforts to improve conditions. 15
Nevertheless, there were signs of improvement in the East
Galician economy. Petroleum fields discovered near Drohobych and
Boryslav promised considerable revenue and laid the foundations for
industrialisation. Between the 1870s and 1914 the budget of the
Galician Diet multiplied 30 times. A Provincial Bank was founded in
1883, a Bank of Industry in 1910. 16 Among the Ruthenian self-help
organisations, "Prosvita" ("Enlightenment"), founded in 1868,
published books on farming methods, sent out agronomists to lecture
on modern farming techniques, arranged for the sale of agricultural
tools at reduced prices, and established associations to provide small
loans at low interest. From 1898 "Sil's'kyi Hospodar" established
machinery stations, experimental farms and agricultural courses;
by 1912, it had 90 branches with 27,000 members. Credit unions,
numerous after 1898, provided cheap credit, though often on
condition of abstinence from alcohol (drink being considered a chief
cause of peasant indebtedness and hence poverty). Consumer

cooperatives and cooperative land banks flourished in the
countryside, while "Narodna Torhivlia" helped commerce in the
towns. A major dairy cooperative in Stryi was one of many such
producers' organisations belonging to the Provincial Audit Union.
From 1892 the "Dnister" association provided affordable insurance to
the Ruthenian masses. 17
Strides were made in the social and cultural areas as well. The
improvement of education in Galicia in the late nineteenth century
had been primarily a Polish accomplishment, and served Polish
interests. In 1871 the Polish language was introduced in all state-
supported primary schools in the province. The Galician School
Board, though nominally under the Viceroy and the Ministry of
Education, became essentially a Galician institution, and established
secondary as well as primary schools and teachers' seminaries
(normal schools). However, as the peasants came to constitute a large
proportion of the pupils, the benefits of educational reform in Eastern
Galicia ifitered down to the Ruthenians. Thus, by 1914 almost half the
elementary schools, and a number of secondary and normal schools,
were Ruthenian in language of instruction. 18 In that year there
were 96 Polish state gymnasia and six Ruthenian ones. The
Emperor's demands for Ruthenian gymnasia were sometimes
refused by the Polish-dominated Galician Diet, for example, in the
case of a gymnasium in Stanyslaviv. Furthermore, it was
considerably more difficult for Ruthenians to be admitted to the state
gymnasia than for Poles, at least in Peremyshl' (Przemyl') and
Ternopil' (Tarnopol). Finally, the 2,457 Ruthenian elementary state
schools existing in 1910 were mostly one- or two-room affairs, often
with Polish teachers, while the 2,909 Polish schools generally had two
to eight rooms. 19 However, the Ruthenian intelligentsia did establish
fifteen private educational institutions and one private normal
school, all under the Land School Union in L'viv (Lemberg, Lw6w).
In higher education, there were seven full professorships and four
lectureships in Ruthenian studies at the University of L'viv by 1914. 20
Adult education flourished too, under the aegis of "Prosvita,"
which organised reading rooms throughout the province. In 1912,

"Prosvita" had 74 branches, 2,611 reading rooms, and over 130,000
members and had published 445 books in over three million copies.
The Shevchenko Scientific Society, founded in 1873 and re-organised
in the 1890s, and financed largely by wealthy Ukrainians from the
Russian Empire, became a sort of Academy of Sciences for the
Ruthenians and their Ukrainian compatriots.21
Ruthenian life in Eastern Galicia also benefited from the
flourishing of theatrical and musical groups. Athletic organisations
like the nationalist "Sokil" (1898) and the socialist "Sich" (1900), with
866 and 794 members, respectively, in 1912, propagated the new
Ukrainian consciousness among the Ruthenians and contributed to
the future military and political leadership of the nation. 22
The demographic picture of Galicia justified the view
that its Easterm and Western parts were fairly distinct. Of the entire
province, which had a population of 7,908,504 in 1897, 3,080,443 were
Ruthenian speaking in 1900 and 3,109,127 were Greek-Uniate by
religion in that year; 23 out of a total of eight million in 1910, 4,670,000
were Poles and 3,200,000 Ruthenians. 24 However, in Eastern Galicia
out of a population of 4,814,171 in 1900, Greek-Catholics constituted
3,022,929 while Latin-rite Catholics amounted to 1,131,330. 25 Although
religious denomination is not a perfect indicator of nationality --
there were Greek-Catholic Poles as well as Latin-rite Catholic
Ruthenians (though these were frequently regarded by their co-
nationals as victims of assimilation) -- these latter figures give a
rough idea of the relative proportions of Ruthenians and Poles in
Eastern Galicia. In Western Galicia, by contrast, the Ruthenians
tended to be linguistically polonised, except in the mountainous
Lemko region in the south.
After World War I and the fall of Austria-Hungary, the
traditional socio-economic and cultural problems of Galicia were
compounded by the difficulties faced by the new Polish state. For the
Ruthenians -- who after their war of independence of 19 18-1920
generally regarded themselves as part of the greater Ukrainian

nation -- there were added the difficulties of rebuilding their life in
the confines of an often hostile national state.
Many of Poland's economic problems were characteristic of
those of inter-war Eastern Europe. In agriculture, the persistence of
strip farming and the large number of dwarf holdings (5 hectares or
less), complicated by the continuing subdivision of landholdings
among the sons of a family, retarded progress. Competition from
American grain and, from about 1930, the effects of the Depression
(especially the dramatic fall in the price of wheat on home markets),
aggravated the situation. The disparity between the prices of
industrial goods (such as ploughs), which remained fairly high, and
the falling prices of agricultural goods -- the notorious "price
scissors" -- contributed to the impoverishment of the peasantry. Only
in the last few years before the outbreak of World War II did a limited
agricultural recovery take place.26
Poland also had to repair the devastation of the World War,
much of which had been fought on what was now her territory.
Agriculture had been particularly hard hit. There was the added
difficulty of integrating the formerly Prussian, Russian and
Austrian lands with their varying systems of communication,
transportation, and education, as well as their disparate economic
orientations. Inflation was very high in the first five years of
independence. Unemployment was rife. The country was
underindustrialised, and little foreign investment in Polish industry
ever materialised. Despite large-scale projects like Gdynia and the
Central Industrial Region, industrialisation developed too slowly.
Growing economic nationalism abroad obstructed Poland's foreign
trade as world agricultural surpluses depressed prices and hindered
her exports. Trade barriers prohibited Poland from obtaining the
foreign exchange she needed to buy imports required for
industrialisation. Meanwhile, the country's standard of living slowly
declined. Land reform, with its attendant parcellation of large
estates, never went far enough, and immigration -- restricted by the

United States in the 1920s and by other states during the Depression -
- never sufficed to relieve the overpopulation of the countryside.27
The state of Poland's agriculture was of particular relevance to
the Ukrainians of Galicia, including the Greek-Catholic clergy. The
overwhelming majority of the population -- for example, 81.3% in
Ternopil county -- were engaged in farming. 28 Overpopulation of the
countryside remained acute, and emigration (about 578,000 in
Eastern Galicia in 1919-1925, about 964,000 in 1926-1930) did not
relieve it here any more than elsewhere in Poland; furthermore,
about half the emigrants returned.29
Also among the problems facing Polish agriculture as a whole
were a lack of capital, primitive techniques, and the land ownership
system. The agricultural yield of wheat in Poland was less than that
of fifteen other European countries in the 1930s. In 1921, 33.9% of the
landholdings were of two hectares or less; another 30.7% were of
between two and five hectares. Together, these constituted 15.3% of
the area under cultivation. Yet five hectares was considered to be the
minimum amount of land needed to support a family. Four million
peasants had no land at all. At the same time, a mere 0.6% of the
holdings, consisting of estates of over a hundred hectares, accounted
for 43% of the land being cultivated. This concentration of ownership
was probably greater than that of any other European country except
Hungary. 30
In the inter-war period commassation of landholdings, an
antidote to wasteful strip farming, was carried out. By 1938, over 40%
of the land involved in the program had been commas sed. 31
The most ambitious reform, however, was the Land Reform
aimounced by a resolution of Parliament in July 1919, and voted into
law in July 1920 under the pressure of the Bolshevik advance, but not
put into effect until the law of 1925 established agrarian offices to
carry it out. Under the reform in its final version, the state would pay
for half the value of an owner's land subject to the reform in cash,

and half in government bonds. The beneficiary would pay five percent
down with forty-one years to pay off the rest, financing to be provided
by the State Land Bank. In addition to private holdings, land of the
State, the Catholic Church (under the 1925 Concordat) and other
public institutions was subject to state purchase. (The parcellation of
Church lands will be discussed in Chapter Three.) General
landholders could retain holdings of no more than 180 hectares;
however, the limit in suburban and industrial areas was 60 hectares,
and in the East, where the landowners were usually Polish and the
beneficiaries of parcellation would have been Belorussians or
Ukrainians, the limit was 300 hectares. 32
The land reform, once it was under way, accommodated only
about a third of the increase of the rural population, with some
130,000 hectares distributed each year. Moreover, the financial
obligations incurred by the recipients of land proved heavy. Worse
still, the average size of small holdings decreased steadily. The
reform was slowed up after Pilsudski's 1926 coup and his
rapprochement with the conservatives, but sped up again under the
Kocia1kowski government in 1935. The greatest progress was in the
eastern and central provinces. However, many landowners took
advantage of the provision of the reform act allowing the owner to
dispose of the land subject to the reform within twelve months of
publication of the notice of expropriation. There was a tendency to
dispose of the inferior part of a holding, and often the purchaser was
a well-to-do peasant rather than a landless peasant or small-holder.
Nevertheless, by 1938 the reform was two-thirds complete, and
the decrease in the number of large estates as well as dwarf holdings
testified to a levelling process -- though this did not relieve the
growing pressure of population on the land. 34 In 1939, there were still
two million farms --over half the peasant holdings -- that were not
large enough to maintain the cultivators at subsistence. On the other
hand, estates of over 50 hectares, owned by fewer than 30,000
individuals, constituted about 24% of the total area under cultivation
in Poland.

From the point of view of the Ukrainian peasants of Galicia,
the reform was not necessarily a good thing. Aside from the
discriminatory differential in the maximum permissible size of
holdings favouring the Polish landowners, there was the fact that the
parcelled lands frequently went to Polish colonists from other
provinces rather than to local Ukrainians. At the same time, the
Ukrainian farm workers employed on large estates that were
parcelled lost their jobs. 36
However, Stanislaw Skrzypek points out that the state
guaranteed the Ukrainians at least an equal share of the parcelled
lands in spite of the fact that the estates belonged mainly to Poles
(thus evidently assuming that the Ukrainians would not normally be
entitled to land parcelled out from Polish-held estates). He cites a
figure of 872,000 acres parcelled in Eastern Galicia between 1919 and
1938, of which 495,000 went th Ukrainians.
Agriculture was no less immune to the ravages of the
Depression than the rest of the Polish economy. The harbinger of
depression was the fall of world timber prices with the reappearance
of Russia on the world market in 1928. Wheat prices fell in the
autunm of 1929 with the over-production of wheat in America and
continued to fall in the following years, bringing down the prices of
other raw agricultural products, on which the balance of trade of
most East European countries depended. However, this disaster for
the small farmer did less harm to the seasonal labourer (so common
among the Ukrainians of Eastern Galicia) working on large estates,
as he was usually paid in kind, with a percentage of the crop he had
harvested. 38
One effect in Eastern Europe of the international
depression was an increasing economic self-reliance, which
contributed to political nationalism and undermined internationalist
tendencies among the working class. Discontent arose among the
older civil servants, victims of cost cuts, and the army officers, as well
as among the recent university graduates who could not find work.
In the countryside, the owner-farmers (rather than the labourers)
most resented the high industrial prices and interest rates. In

Poland as elsewhere in Eastern Europe, in view of the heavy Jewish
representation in banking and industry, such feelings were easily
translated into anti-Semitism. The scarcity of jobs exacerbated inter-
ethnic tensions in general. Throughout Eastern Europe, the position
of national minorities began to deteriorate.39
Poland seemed to be faced with intractable problems.
Broad economic discontent surfaced in the general strike of
November 1923, the industrial strikes of 1936, and the agricultural
strike of August 1937. Even the most energetic reforms could not
solve the country's difficulties. Although the judgment of Samuel
